          "textDisplay": "_As He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \u201cTell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?\u201d Jesus answered them, _*_\u201cTake heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled. For all these things must happen, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines, epidemics, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you. And you will be hated by all nations for My name\u2019s sake. Then many will fall away, and betray one another, and hate one another. And many false prophets will rise and will deceive many. Because iniquity will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\u201d_*_ Matthew 24:3\u202d-14 MEV_\r\n(OBS: From the beginning of the tribulation to the end there are 7 years, the antichrist will make a peace treaty of 7 years and it will include Israel, but it will be a false peace! For the Gospel to be preached to the whole world would be impossible without technology of global communication.)\r\n\r\n*_When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you know that its desolation has drawn near._*_ Luke 21:20 MEV_\r\n*_So when you see the \u2018abomination of desolation,\u2019 spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place,(...)_*_ Matthew 24:15 MEV_\r\n_\u201cAnd he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator.\u201d Daniel 9:27_\r\n(OBS: False peace treaty of 7 years. \u201cone week\u201d means seven years, the reason why Daniel wrote it that way is because of Daniel 12:9 when the angel tells Daniel \u201cto seal the words for the time of the end\u201d so it could only be understood by combining the book of Daniel with the book of Revelation.)\r\n_\u201cHis armies shall rise up and desecrate the sanctuary fortress. They shall abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination that makes desolate.\u201d Daniel 11:31 MEV_\r\n_\u201cFrom the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.\u201d Daniel 12:11 MEV_\r\n(OBS: These events will take place after the construction of the third temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, during the seven-year false peace treaty. The one thousand two hundred and ninety days are the time given for the beast to rule the world, this beast is the government of the antichrist.)\r\n *_(...)then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. Let him who is in the field not return to take his clothes. Woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse in those days! Pray that your escape will not be in the winter or on the Sabbath. For then will be great tribulation, such as has not happened since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be. Unless those days were shortened, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened._*_ Matthew 24:16\u202d-22 MEV_\r\n\r\n*_There will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; men fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth. For the powers of heaven will be shaken._*_ Luke 21:25-26 MEV_\r\n(OBS: In the age of technology, men know what is happening on the inhabited earth, no longer are they limited by local information.)\r\n*_Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other._*_ Matthew 24:29\u202d-31 MEV_\r\n(OBS: This is the sixth seal of the book of Revelation, pay much attention here, for the signs of the sixth seal >match< the signs of Matthew 24:29-30, the sixth seal is when the rapture happens; before the great tribulation, before the seven trumpets.)\r\n*_When these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption is drawing near._*_ Luke 21:28 MEV_\r\n\r\n*_Because you have kept My word of patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the entire world, to test those who dwell on the earth._*_ Revelation 3:10 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture before the time of temptation, which will be the government of the antichrist during the great tribulation.)\r\n\r\n_For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 1 Thessalonians 4:16 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture.)\r\n\r\n*_For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man._*_ Matthew 24:38\u202d-\u202c39 MEV_\r\n(OBS: People will not be eating and drinking and marrying during the great tribulation, therefore, rapture will happen before the great tribulation, when people are still distracted.)\r\n\r\n_When they say, \u201cPeace and safety!\u201d then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Sudden destruction near the rapture.)\r\n\r\n_For the mystery of lawlessness is already working. Only He who is now restraining him will do so until He is taken out of the way. Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth, and destroy with the brightness of His presence, 2 Thessalonians 2:7 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Who is restraining the antichrist from revealing himself? Who is stopping the antichrist from rising? The adopted sons of God! When the elect are raptured, the antichrist will be free to take over. Rapture will trigger the great tribulation and the government of the antichrist.)\r\n\r\n*_Two will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left.

          "textOriginal": "_As He sat on the Mount of Olives, the disciples came to Him privately, saying, \u201cTell us, when will these things be, and what will be the sign of Your coming and of the end of the age?\u201d Jesus answered them, _*_\u201cTake heed that no one deceives you. For many will come in My name, saying, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled. For all these things must happen, but the end is not yet. For nation will rise against nation, and kingdom against kingdom. There will be famines, epidemics, and earthquakes in various places. All these are the beginning of sorrows. Then they will hand you over to be persecuted and will kill you. And you will be hated by all nations for My name\u2019s sake. Then many will fall away, and betray one another, and hate one another. And many false prophets will rise and will deceive many. Because iniquity will abound, the love of many will grow cold. But he who endures to the end shall be saved. And this gospel of the kingdom will be preached throughout the world as a testimony to all nations, and then the end will come.\u201d_*_ Matthew 24:3\u202d-14 MEV_\r\n(OBS: From the beginning of the tribulation to the end there are 7 years, the antichrist will make a peace treaty of 7 years and it will include Israel, but it will be a false peace! For the Gospel to be preached to the whole world would be impossible without technology of global communication.)\r\n\r\n*_When you see Jerusalem surrounded by armies, then you know that its desolation has drawn near._*_ Luke 21:20 MEV_\r\n*_So when you see the \u2018abomination of desolation,\u2019 spoken of by Daniel the prophet, standing in the holy place,(...)_*_ Matthew 24:15 MEV_\r\n_\u201cAnd he shall make a firm covenant with many for one week. But in the middle of the week he shall cause the sacrifice and the offering to cease. And on the wing of abominations shall come one who makes desolate, until the decreed destruction is poured out on the desolator.\u201d Daniel 9:27_\r\n(OBS: False peace treaty of 7 years. \u201cone week\u201d means seven years, the reason why Daniel wrote it that way is because of Daniel 12:9 when the angel tells Daniel \u201cto seal the words for the time of the end\u201d so it could only be understood by combining the book of Daniel with the book of Revelation.)\r\n_\u201cHis armies shall rise up and desecrate the sanctuary fortress. They shall abolish the daily sacrifice and set up the abomination that makes desolate.\u201d Daniel 11:31 MEV_\r\n_\u201cFrom the time that the daily sacrifice shall be taken away and the abomination that makes desolate set up, there shall be one thousand two hundred and ninety days.\u201d Daniel 12:11 MEV_\r\n(OBS: These events will take place after the construction of the third temple of Solomon in Jerusalem, during the seven-year false peace treaty. The one thousand two hundred and ninety days are the time given for the beast to rule the world, this beast is the government of the antichrist.)\r\n *_(...)then let those who are in Judea flee to the mountains. Let him who is on the housetop not go down to take anything out of his house. Let him who is in the field not return to take his clothes. Woe to those who are with child and to those who nurse in those days! Pray that your escape will not be in the winter or on the Sabbath. For then will be great tribulation, such as has not happened since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be. Unless those days were shortened, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened._*_ Matthew 24:16\u202d-22 MEV_\r\n\r\n*_There will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; men fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth. For the powers of heaven will be shaken._*_ Luke 21:25-26 MEV_\r\n(OBS: In the age of technology, men know what is happening on the inhabited earth, no longer are they limited by local information.)\r\n*_Immediately after the tribulation of those days, the sun will be darkened, the moon will not give its light; the stars will fall from heaven, and the powers of the heavens will be shaken. Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other._*_ Matthew 24:29\u202d-31 MEV_\r\n(OBS: This is the sixth seal of the book of Revelation, pay much attention here, for the signs of the sixth seal >match< the signs of Matthew 24:29-30, the sixth seal is when the rapture happens; before the great tribulation, before the seven trumpets.)\r\n*_When these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption is drawing near._*_ Luke 21:28 MEV_\r\n\r\n*_Because you have kept My word of patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the entire world, to test those who dwell on the earth._*_ Revelation 3:10 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture before the time of temptation, which will be the government of the antichrist during the great tribulation.)\r\n\r\n_For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God. And the dead in Christ will rise first. 1 Thessalonians 4:16 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture.)\r\n\r\n*_For as in the days before the flood, they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving in marriage, until the day Noah entered the ark, and did not know until the flood came and took them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man._*_ Matthew 24:38\u202d-\u202c39 MEV_\r\n(OBS: People will not be eating and drinking and marrying during the great tribulation, therefore, rapture will happen before the great tribulation, when people are still distracted.)\r\n\r\n_When they say, \u201cPeace and safety!\u201d then sudden destruction will come upon them as labor upon a woman with child, and they shall not escape. 1 Thessalonians 5:3 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Sudden destruction near the rapture.)\r\n\r\n_For the mystery of lawlessness is already working. Only He who is now restraining him will do so until He is taken out of the way. Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth, and destroy with the brightness of His presence, 2 Thessalonians 2:7 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Who is restraining the antichrist from revealing himself? Who is stopping the antichrist from rising? The adopted sons of God! When the elect are raptured, the antichrist will be free to take over. Rapture will trigger the great tribulation and the government of the antichrist.)\r\n\r\n*_Two will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and the other left._*_ Matthew 24:40\u202d-41 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture.)\r\n\r\n_Know this first, that there shall come scoffers in the last days who walk after their own lusts, and say, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming?
