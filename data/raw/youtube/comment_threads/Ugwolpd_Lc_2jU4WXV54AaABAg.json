          "textDisplay": "Secrets of Azovstal: \nThe interesting thing about Klaus Schwab is his predecessor, G\u00fcnther Schwab- who was a former Sturmabteilung (Brownshirt) and a committed member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) back in 1930. G\u00fcnther founded the World League for the Protection of Life in 1960 some years after the fall of Nazi Germany.  \n \nThis vision was fueled by social Darwinism, Aryan biased eugenics measures, and given the push-back he received\u2014 he switched gears into pushing for Nazism ideals by masking his agenda using ecology & a green movement to force radical change to justify the means of his more sinister plans of bringing about the 4th Reich. \n \nG\u00fcnther died around 2006 but made great headway in bringing about the 4th reich. His spirit lives on today with Klaus Schwab, head of the WEF (World Economic Forum) and leader of the Davos convention. He was the head lead to everything that you see today, from the pandemic, to even the war in Ukraine.  \n \nI also want to point out that Canada has been doing joint operation training with Neo-Nazi groups such as the Azov Battalion & C14 within Ukraine just a few months prior to Russia\u2019s invasion. Furthermore, the US State Department confirmed existence of multiple biolabs (BSL-4: highest biolab safety level) that likely contain deadly pathogens or genetic weapons, all funded by the DoD. Totally no coincidence at all, right? Especially with what Trudeau is doing in Canada? Wake up, people. \n \nI am unsure if G\u00fcnther is biologically related to Klaus, but that is irrelevant. What is relevant is how eerily self-similar their ideological framework is set within their organizations. Predecessor is not limited to blood-relation; it\u2019s more about picking up what was left off. I assumed this was obvious but seeing some of these comments have clearly pointed out the pint-sized consciousnesses in our concurrent \u201cNWO-controlled\u201d populace. Hopefully this elevates the collective unconscious, as Jung termed, by bringing about clarity & awareness through threads like these. Maybe I\u2019ll do more than just this in the future \n \nI could further stress Bill Gates and other Zionist technocrats that work with this Neo-Nazi fascist regime, but I assumed that connection would be quite easy to make. For example: Zelensky the puppet is Jewish. If the odds justify the means, they\u2019ll do it. Even Hitler had an SS infantry unit composed of around 4500 Indians from India escaping persecution. \n \nThese henchmen (Klaus Schwab, Justin T, Zelensky, Zolomoyskyi, Yuval, etc.) are merely hired blue collared criminals compared to the true upper-tier society of elites- a circle of tyrants, if you will, and I suspect these elites are actual 4th Reich Nazi\u2019s who mask themselves from society. Mark all operation paperclip scientists and Nuermberg trial escapees as potential elites, trace their bloodline, as they are certainly a part of their hierarchy much like Klaus Schwab here. \n \nPlease research the following individuals: \n- Archive on wiki Ihor (Igor) Kolomoyskyi \n- Archive on wiki Lead Eugenicist & Biotechnological Engineer of WEF Yuval Noah Harari \n- Archive on wiki BlackRock Brian Deese \n- Look into the new super avian flu shaking the poultry supply chain and look into the H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine patents underway. \n- Breaking News: $2.4 billion fund under Hunter Biden \ninvolved in financing US-backed biolabs in \nUkraine  \n- Archive the Haavara Agreement & look up _ Schwab (ROTHSCHILD), MARIANNE _ , for this shows how Israel ties into all of this & how they\u2019re the central powerhouse to all of this. Zionists & Nazi\u2019s get along very, very well because it\u2019s a chicken & egg scenario, and I\u2019m starting to think the Zionists laid the Nazi egg. Zionists don\u2019t want impurities, even within their own people, any more than the Nazi\u2019s do. They\u2019ve likely found ways to agree with each other on what\u2019s superior and what\u2019s inferior as far as genetics goes. At this point, the Neo-Nazi\u2019s everywhere are merely cannon fodder for the storm of war that is quickly approaching our doorsteps.  \n \nThe Russian Defense Ministry released on March 24 the latest results on the analysis of information about the 30 Pentagon-funded Ukrainian biolabs engaged in dangerous and illegal research on deadly pathogens. US officials and Western media at first denied that such labs existed, but a senior administration official has subsequently confirmed their presence, according to Sputnik.

          "textOriginal": "Secrets of Azovstal: \nThe interesting thing about Klaus Schwab is his predecessor, G\u00fcnther Schwab- who was a former Sturmabteilung (Brownshirt) and a committed member of the NSDAP (Nazi Party) back in 1930. G\u00fcnther founded the World League for the Protection of Life in 1960 some years after the fall of Nazi Germany.  \n \nThis vision was fueled by social Darwinism, Aryan biased eugenics measures, and given the push-back he received\u2014 he switched gears into pushing for Nazism ideals by masking his agenda using ecology & a green movement to force radical change to justify the means of his more sinister plans of bringing about the 4th Reich. \n \nG\u00fcnther died around 2006 but made great headway in bringing about the 4th reich. His spirit lives on today with Klaus Schwab, head of the WEF (World Economic Forum) and leader of the Davos convention. He was the head lead to everything that you see today, from the pandemic, to even the war in Ukraine.  \n \nI also want to point out that Canada has been doing joint operation training with Neo-Nazi groups such as the Azov Battalion & C14 within Ukraine just a few months prior to Russia\u2019s invasion. Furthermore, the US State Department confirmed existence of multiple biolabs (BSL-4: highest biolab safety level) that likely contain deadly pathogens or genetic weapons, all funded by the DoD. Totally no coincidence at all, right? Especially with what Trudeau is doing in Canada? Wake up, people. \n \nI am unsure if G\u00fcnther is biologically related to Klaus, but that is irrelevant. What is relevant is how eerily self-similar their ideological framework is set within their organizations. Predecessor is not limited to blood-relation; it\u2019s more about picking up what was left off. I assumed this was obvious but seeing some of these comments have clearly pointed out the pint-sized consciousnesses in our concurrent \u201cNWO-controlled\u201d populace. Hopefully this elevates the collective unconscious, as Jung termed, by bringing about clarity & awareness through threads like these. Maybe I\u2019ll do more than just this in the future \n \nI could further stress Bill Gates and other Zionist technocrats that work with this Neo-Nazi fascist regime, but I assumed that connection would be quite easy to make. For example: Zelensky the puppet is Jewish. If the odds justify the means, they\u2019ll do it. Even Hitler had an SS infantry unit composed of around 4500 Indians from India escaping persecution. \n \nThese henchmen (Klaus Schwab, Justin T, Zelensky, Zolomoyskyi, Yuval, etc.) are merely hired blue collared criminals compared to the true upper-tier society of elites- a circle of tyrants, if you will, and I suspect these elites are actual 4th Reich Nazi\u2019s who mask themselves from society. Mark all operation paperclip scientists and Nuermberg trial escapees as potential elites, trace their bloodline, as they are certainly a part of their hierarchy much like Klaus Schwab here. \n \nPlease research the following individuals: \n- Archive on wiki Ihor (Igor) Kolomoyskyi \n- Archive on wiki Lead Eugenicist & Biotechnological Engineer of WEF Yuval Noah Harari \n- Archive on wiki BlackRock Brian Deese \n- Look into the new super avian flu shaking the poultry supply chain and look into the H5N1 (bird flu) vaccine patents underway. \n- Breaking News: $2.4 billion fund under Hunter Biden \ninvolved in financing US-backed biolabs in \nUkraine  \n- Archive the Haavara Agreement & look up _ Schwab (ROTHSCHILD), MARIANNE _ , for this shows how Israel ties into all of this & how they\u2019re the central powerhouse to all of this. Zionists & Nazi\u2019s get along very, very well because it\u2019s a chicken & egg scenario, and I\u2019m starting to think the Zionists laid the Nazi egg. Zionists don\u2019t want impurities, even within their own people, any more than the Nazi\u2019s do. They\u2019ve likely found ways to agree with each other on what\u2019s superior and what\u2019s inferior as far as genetics goes.
