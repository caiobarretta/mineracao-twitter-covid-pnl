And i didnt notice the low cost of healthy until i live in Canada, another good health care country. Hong Kong and Singapore even provide low cost medical service to tourists or foreigners. If u got sick like say fever or broken elbow (touch wood), u can go to those walk in clinic or local hospital and they charge u very little. My friend from Belgium got into a car accident and required to stay in local hospital, he paid like $100 USD only. Not only do the cost is kept very affordable, the care and standard were very high too. Both countries were highly educated, just look at their universities' ranking on the global scale. I have to give them credit and recognition for providing health care to people. Their government really emphasize ethic rather than just all about money. Also, to be fair, these countries have like 5-7 millions people only, its a lot easier to manage. And their city (country for singapore) are only as big as a LA, so its a lot easier to manage",
