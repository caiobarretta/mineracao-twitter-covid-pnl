For many will come in My name, saying, \u2018I am the Christ,\u2019 and will deceive many. You will hear of wars and rumors of wars. See that you are not troubled.

Then many will fall away, and betray one another, and hate one another. And many false prophets will rise and will deceive many. Because iniquity will abound, the love of many will grow cold.

For then will be great tribulation, such as has not happened since the beginning of the world until now, no, nor ever shall be. Unless those days were shortened, no one would be saved. But for the sake of the elect those days will be shortened._*_ Matthew 24:16\u202d-22 MEV_\r\n\r\n*_There will be signs in the sun and the moon and the stars; and on the earth distress of nations, with perplexity, the sea and the waves roaring; men fainting from fear and expectation of what is coming on the inhabited earth.

Then the sign of the Son of Man will appear in heaven, and then all the tribes of the earth will mourn, and they will see the Son of Man coming on the clouds of heaven with power and great glory. And He will send His angels with a great sound of a trumpet, and they shall gather His elect from the four winds, from one end of the heavens to the other._*_ Matthew 24:29\u202d-31 MEV_\r\n(OBS: This is the sixth seal of the book of Revelation, pay much attention here, for the signs of the sixth seal >match< the signs of Matthew 24:29-30, the sixth seal is when the rapture happens; before the great tribulation, before the seven trumpets.)\r\n*_When these things begin to happen, look up and lift up your heads, for your redemption is drawing near._*_ Luke 21:28 MEV_\r\n\r\n*_Because you have kept My word of patience, I also will keep you from the hour of temptation which shall come upon the entire world, to test those who dwell on the earth._*_ Revelation 3:10 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture before the time of temptation, which will be the government of the antichrist during the great tribulation.)\r\n\r\n_For the Lord Himself will descend from heaven with a shout, with the voice of the archangel, and with the trumpet call of God.

Who is stopping the antichrist from rising? The adopted sons of God! When the elect are raptured, the antichrist will be free to take over. Rapture will trigger the great tribulation and the government of the antichrist.)\r\n\r\n*_Two will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and the other left._*_ Matthew 24:40\u202d-41 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture.)\r\n\r\n_Know this first, that there shall come scoffers in the last days who walk after their own lusts, and say, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were since the beginning of the creation.\u201d 2 Peter 3:3\u202d-4 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Apostasy of the last days, when more and more men are denying God and going after their own sinful desires.)\r\n\r\n_But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat. The earth also and the works that are in it will be burned up. 2 Peter 3:10 MEV_\r\n(OBS: The destructions that will happen near the rapture, just as the days of Sodom and Gomorrah; the righteous is rescued and the judgements are poured upon the wicked, and \u201clike a thief in the night\u201d means it will happen when you do not expect, \u201cheavens will pass away\u201d means the sky will vanish as a scroll that is being rolled up, which is mentioned in Revelation 6:14.)\r\n\r\n_In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 1 Corinthians 15:52 MEV_\r\n(OBS: People around the world have been hearing trumpets from the sky in different times, it has been happening for a few years. When the last trumpet sound, the redeemed will be rescued and the great tribulation will begin.)\r\n\r\n_He causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one may buy or sell, except he who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name.

Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase. Daniel 12:4 MEV_\r\n(OBS: In the last days, many people travel to many places and knowledge is increased.)\r\n\r\n*_For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life._*_ John 3:16 MEV_\r\n\r\nBehold the Lord of lords is coming soon, repent now of all your sins \u2014 stay away from all sins \u2014 and abide in the only Savior and Lord Jesus the Christ (Yeshua the Messiah) with all your heart, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.",

Only He who is now restraining him will do so until He is taken out of the way. Then the lawless one will be revealed, whom the Lord will consume with the breath of His mouth, and destroy with the brightness of His presence, 2 Thessalonians 2:7 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Who is restraining the antichrist from revealing himself? Who is stopping the antichrist from rising? The adopted sons of God! When the elect are raptured, the antichrist will be free to take over. Rapture will trigger the great tribulation and the government of the antichrist.)\r\n\r\n*_Two will be in the field; one will be taken, and the other left. Two women will be grinding at the mill; one will be taken, and the other left._*_ Matthew 24:40\u202d-41 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Rapture.)\r\n\r\n_Know this first, that there shall come scoffers in the last days who walk after their own lusts, and say, \u201cWhere is the promise of His coming? For since the fathers fell asleep, all things have continued as they were since the beginning of the creation.\u201d 2 Peter 3:3\u202d-4 MEV_\r\n(OBS: Apostasy of the last days, when more and more men are denying God and going after their own sinful desires.)\r\n\r\n_But the day of the Lord will come like a thief in the night, in which the heavens will pass away with a loud noise, and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat. The earth also and the works that are in it will be burned up. 2 Peter 3:10 MEV_\r\n(OBS: The destructions that will happen near the rapture, just as the days of Sodom and Gomorrah; the righteous is rescued and the judgements are poured upon the wicked, and \u201clike a thief in the night\u201d means it will happen when you do not expect, \u201cheavens will pass away\u201d means the sky will vanish as a scroll that is being rolled up, which is mentioned in Revelation 6:14.)\r\n\r\n_In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will sound, the dead will be raised incorruptible, and we shall be changed. 1 Corinthians 15:52 MEV_\r\n(OBS: People around the world have been hearing trumpets from the sky in different times, it has been happening for a few years. When the last trumpet sound, the redeemed will be rescued and the great tribulation will begin.)\r\n\r\n_He causes all, both small and great, both rich and poor, both free and slave, to receive a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, so that no one may buy or sell, except he who has the mark or the name of the beast or the number of his name. Revelation 13:16\u202d-17 MEV_\r\n(OBS: In the last days, no one will be able to buy or sell without a mark from the government/beast of the antichrist, which will take place during the great tribulation, which is at the door.)\r\n\r\n_But you, Daniel, shut up the words and seal the book until the time of the end. Many shall run to and fro, and knowledge shall increase. Daniel 12:4 MEV_\r\n(OBS: In the last days, many people travel to many places and knowledge is increased.)\r\n\r\n*_For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that whoever believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life._*_ John 3:16 MEV_\r\n\r\nBehold the Lord of lords is coming soon, repent now of all your sins \u2014 stay away from all sins \u2014 and abide in the only Savior and Lord Jesus the Christ (Yeshua the Messiah) with all your heart, for the kingdom of heaven is at hand.",
