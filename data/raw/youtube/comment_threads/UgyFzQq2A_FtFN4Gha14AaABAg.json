Sometimes the nomenclature \u201cstrain\u201d is used to mean a family or branch of virus variants coming from a common ancestor but this should be called a \u201cclade\u201d.  Sometimes \u201cstrain\u201d is used to mean one of eight lineages or some sub-lineage, but there are actually high-level clades.  Strain is open to different interpretations but it usually means a virus variant that has some very different properties, which entails a subjective opinion.  Strictly speaking, a variant becomes a strain when it has a demonstrably different phenotype (e.g., a difference in antigenicity, transmissibility, or virulence).\r\n\r\nA rule of thumb is that variants all respond to the same vaccine (perhaps with different speeds or efficacy) but different strains usually need different vaccines to have serious stopping power.  Some experts are arguing that the Delta variant has already evolved into a new strain, SARS-CoV-3 maybe.  The Delta variant is likely in a gray area between the two arguments so 3 doses of an existing vaccine should still stop this variant (i.e. prevent any symptoms).  But it is not yet a new strain.\r\n\r\nI don\u2019t think a third dose is warranted for the vast majority of people (yet).  Vaccinated people can handle a week of sniffles and many unvaccinated people in some places are still waiting for a first dose.  The Delta variant is more transmissible (including from and to people with some immunity) but likely it is not more deadly on a single case basis.  And possibly even less deadly since it tends to stay in the upper respiratory tract where it can spread to others more easily but where it causes less lung and other vital organ damage (but the younger age groups being infected with it may be a factor here).  The good news is a more transmissible virus will end the pandemic sooner, but at a huge price.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s a saying that what doesn\u2019t kill you makes you stronger.  It certainly applies to microbes with all the antibiotic-resistant versions of bacteria arising.  Antigenic drift and antigenic shift continually give rise to new variants but most of these variants just disappear.  Strong natural selection among competing viruses leaves just the fittest to spread.  Suppressing the Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Epsilon, Zeta, Eta, Theta, Iota, Kappa and Lambda variants with vaccines has left the field wide open to one variant that knows how to evade antibodies a bit better than all the others \u2013 that\u2019s the Delta variant.  The Delta variant arose in India before vaccines were a consideration (it was detected in October 2020) and it remained secondary to the Alpha variant until after the huge May 2021 wave in India when many people acquired some natural immunity.  As people acquired immunity, the advantage of the Delta variant could be put to use.  Keep an eye on Delta Plus too\u2014it\u2019s a subvariant of Delta \u2014 it likes lung cells.\r\n\r\nIn any case, SARS-CoV-2 is just an Influenza-like virus temporarily on steroids.
