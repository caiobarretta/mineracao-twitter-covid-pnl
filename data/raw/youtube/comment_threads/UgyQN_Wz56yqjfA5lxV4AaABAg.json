I do have to disagree with your final conclusion though.  While it is unlikely you are in an early upswing in your infection, it is somewhat likely your PCR test was nearing it's LOD with a CT value so high and by the time you retested, it was below threshold, lowering the sensitivity of your follow up PCR test. I would only agree it was a false positive if you were antibody negative at this point. Thanks again for TWIV!",
