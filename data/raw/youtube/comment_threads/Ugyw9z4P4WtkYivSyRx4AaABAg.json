As an example, if 1000 people were infected on day 1 and the average person died on day 14, and there were 80 deaths on day 14, but 99,000 new cases on day 14, shouldn\u2019t we say the morality rate is 8%? Because 99,000 people would still be waiting for their fate. But if we knew the average day it takes for a person to die, we could better calculate mortality rate. In 1 month there could be 2 million cases because of doubling rate with only 3000 deaths, giving people the false belief that the mortality rate is 0.15%. It seems he\u2019s calculating 17k  confirmed cases vs 362 dead to equal 2%. Does that makes sense?  Although, I also think the mortality rate would heavily depend on the population density of a given area, severity of an outbreak in that area, and healthcare abilities in that area. Sorry but I have a math skill of a 6th grader so maybe I am thinking about this all wrong. But I got kids so trying to get accurate estimates to plan ahead, ya know?",
