I'm an RN and work in case management. The only difference is the dizziness and migraines are almost gone. But I have pretty bad chest pain and lung tightness,currently. You mentioned you had Lyme disease. I think covid brings out old infections such as Lyme,  Epstein bar, shingles, cmv, etc. I have no autoimmune dx, but my lung dx is the same, as you. I feel SOB all the time. I don't have the blood sugar problem, but I know viruses can cause New diabetes.",
