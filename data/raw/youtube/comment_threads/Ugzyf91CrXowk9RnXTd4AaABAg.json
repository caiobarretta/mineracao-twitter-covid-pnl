I know he's only going by what was said in the media by Oxford, but when it comes to DNA, I can't help but think of the CCR5 cell. I know that they reported that it doesn't effect our genetics, but it's way too soon to know that! When you think about HIV and the 2 receptors that it needs to have a binding affect, it's from CD4 and CCR5, but in people where the CCR5 was defective, you won't catch the virus. It wasn't until a few years ago that we learned how when you change your own CCR5 or completely get rid of it, that you lose an average of a third of your lifespan. So I am a skeptic, but if there was more transparency, I would be able to research it on my own, and not make a rash decision.",

There are a number of other vaccines in trial as well using different biologic techniques and its quite likely that in the end the \"best\" approach will be to give everybody a mix of two or more vaccines.",

The more I read about adenovirus-based viral vector vaccines, the more I encounter the issue precisely of the viral DNA integrating into the host DNA and disrupting normal cell function. I was skeptical of the mRNA vaccines at first, but it seems that  these first generation vaccines offer us the choice between potential autoimmunity and potential cancers down the road.  BTW, I am NOT an antivaxxer, I vaccinate my children, believe in the usefulness of vaccination for public health, and am ready to take a well-tested vaccine. I do however worry when the information we receive is carefully photoshopped, although I understand the public health needs of governments to tackle the pandemic fast and without lockdowns.  :(",

But DNA is very stable and could remain in my body for years or even for the rest of my life (am I correct about this?). Will this injected DNA keep on producing spike proteins for months or even years? If not, why not? Might this cause my body to have a continuous, albeit low level, immune response to these spike proteins? It seems to me that this could have negative effects. I couldn't find anything directly addressing this by using Google search. Do you have any thoughts on this? Very respectfully, Mark.",
