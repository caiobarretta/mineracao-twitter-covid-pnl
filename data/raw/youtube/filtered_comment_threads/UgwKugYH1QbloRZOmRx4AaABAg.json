I wish I had a biology/science teacher like you when I was in school. I live in the Wenzhou area of Zhejiang Province, China. I am of the opinion that you are spot on in regards to the numbers regarding virus cases. As of this writing, there are 829 confirmed cases in Zhejiang .  However, yesterday we received a report after the city was locked down that there 1037 suspected cases in one suburb of Wenzhou alone. In my city, there were 298.  The (partial) report that we were given yesterday has 6,613 suspected cases in our immediate area. This number does not include Wenzhou city itself, nor other cities and suburbs within Zhejiang Province.",
