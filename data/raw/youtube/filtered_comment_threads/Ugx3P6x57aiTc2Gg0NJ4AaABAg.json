The Omicron wave did not start in Shanghai and it was the only place hit by it. \n\nThe wave started in Hong Kong, then Shenzhen, Shanghai and Jilin all had outbreaks around the same time. Shenzhen imposed a lockdown early on and it only took them one week. Jilin had a much bigger outbreak but it was also contained. \n\nIt was only in Shanghai that the government tried something that deviated from zero-COVID policy. The central government let them test it for several weeks, and the result was tens of thousands of infections and continuous stream of COVID-infected people spreading it to the other provinces.\n\nPeople in Shanghai might blame zero-COVID policy for their sufferings, but the rest of China blame Shanghai government for the whole mess. The consensus of the Chinese people, minus Shanghai, is that Omicron can be contained, and that zero-COVID is the right thing to do.",
