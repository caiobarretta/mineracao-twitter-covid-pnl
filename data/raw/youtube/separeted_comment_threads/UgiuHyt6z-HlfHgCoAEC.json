        "textDisplay": "How does Corona handle surfaces that become more sharply reflective at glancing angles? In the real world a material may be pretty rough at low incidence angles, but when you look down the length of the object it becomes more mirror like. TheaRender accounts for this (as a material option). So it's not just that the fresnel effect should decrease with increasing roughness, but alternatively a surface's roughness should INCREASE at glancing angles.",
