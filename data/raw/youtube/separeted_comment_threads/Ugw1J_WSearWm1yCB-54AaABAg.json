Sometimes \u201cstrain\u201d is used to mean one of eight lineages or some sub-lineage, but there are actually high-level clades.

Some experts are arguing that the Delta variant has already evolved into a new strain, SARS-CoV-3 maybe.  The Delta variant is likely in a gray area between the two arguments so 3 doses of an existing vaccine should still stop this variant (i.e. prevent any symptoms).

Strong natural selection among competing viruses leaves just the fittest to spread.

Simply put that the vaccine train your immune system into identifying who is a friend or a foe in case of the COVID by way of making your own cells replicate the protein that are part of the outer membrane structure of a coronavirus. Then your immune system start to train and react to neutralize such a foreign intruder and learn to recognize such thing in case of a future repeat, that is why there is a need to reinforce the learning of the immune system with a second dose at least.",
