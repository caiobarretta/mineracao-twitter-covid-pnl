        "textDisplay": "According to some recent papers,  covid-19 antibodies have been found in lots of patient samples from Italy Sept 2019, and US as early as Dec 2019 (collected from 9 US states?). Considering the transmission speed and week it took for antibodies to form for a patient, they are both earlier than the first case from Asia. Another interesting observation is about the covid-19 antibodies found from white tailed deers in Michigan, and one sample can also trace back to Dec 2019.  In addition, according to Cambridge University's research,  the dominat strain in East Asia (strain-B) is quite different from the main strain in US and Austrilia (strain-A and Strain-C) at the beginning of the pandemic. If we take all these into consideration, it is not easy to just associate the virus with Wuhan.",
