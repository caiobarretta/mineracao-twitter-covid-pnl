HK is easing up covid measures as new infections have been dropping to a very manageable level - just 200-300 new cases per day. This is no way near the 150-170k cases in the USA whilst hospitalization cases are also spiking. In addition, HK people are still wearing masks and having some social distancing measures. So, things are not comparable at all.",
