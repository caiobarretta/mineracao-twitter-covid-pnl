One point is that America thinks of \"freedom\" as individual choice. That's why you can't pull together as a country. Any form of collectivism is rejected as being \"socialist\" but in some areas such as labour laws and healthcare collectivism would take a great burden off many people ie. collectivism in these areas would give people greater freedom from struggle and worry. A more secure, healthier population would be less disillusioned and more inclined to be supportive of governments and  more likely to pull together",
