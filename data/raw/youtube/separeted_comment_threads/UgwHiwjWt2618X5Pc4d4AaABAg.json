        "textDisplay": "IMPORTANT UPDATE: Hi everyone. As many have commented, the hypothesis of the origin of SARS-CoV-2 mentioned in this video is outdated and highly likely to be incorrect. At the time of recording this lesson (April 2020), what was mentioned in this lesson was the prevailing hypothesis. But as time has gone on,  new evidence has emerged, and this is NOT the prevailing hypothesis at present. So, please disregard what is mentioned here for the possible origin of SARS-CoV-2. The reproductive number and mortality rate of SARS-CoV-2 is likely different (due to different variants) than what is presented here as well. Other information is accurate. If there is any other information that is incorrect, please let me know. Thanks -  I hope you all find this lesson helpful and informative, and my apologies for not providing an update sooner. JJ.",
