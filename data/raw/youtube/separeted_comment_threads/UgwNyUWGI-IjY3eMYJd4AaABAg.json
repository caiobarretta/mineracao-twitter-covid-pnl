I started reading online and found the name of this newest virus had SARS in it, and started digging for more info to try to understand. I searched youtube, and your video was the first, and really only one, I found. I was and am extremely impressed, and thank you for sharing your knowledge not only for those who have some medical training, but for those who do not and are seeking answers and understanding. You are a gem, and I wish I had you as a professor in university! Thank you for all your videos, please keep making them! I am grateful...in New York!",
