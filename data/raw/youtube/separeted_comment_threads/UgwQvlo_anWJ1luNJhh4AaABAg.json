        "textDisplay": "I saw them live in Boston, Mass (Opera House) on Aug. 18, 1984 with the original crew, including Pete and Will. I only went because the girl I liked was obsessed with them. She and another girl I liked went backstage to visit with them while I waited in a Boston alley for 2 or 3 hours, breathing in diesel exhaust from their truck and wondering where they were. I saw Will and he stood right next to me. I said, :Good show, Will.\" he said \"Thanks.\" then I described the chicks and asked if he saw them. He did not. I also saw Pete riding a 10-speed through downtown Boston so late at night. I thought, how does he know where he's going. He's from England. He was later killed on a motorcycle. They wwre not bad as far as bands go. Actually, pretty good. The girls? They spent the night with the road manager. I guess they weren't hot enough for Ian. It still rankles me from time to time. One of the girls is now gone and buried outside of Boston. Just thought I would add this.",
