One very important point you made, was that the other two vaccines may only\nprevent symptoms of the disease, and not prevent infection, whereas the Oxford vaccine may\nprevent both. And now, I want to raise another subject relative to vaccines, and SARS-CoV-2:\nIn a peer-reviewed article published in the American Journal of Microbiology, the authors presented strong associative evidence that vaccination with the MMR 11 (Measles, Mumps, Rubella) vaccine, can offer up to 70% protection against infection with the SARS-CoV-2 virus.\nThis happens because the viral signatures of those three viruses are quite similar to the the viral signature of the SARS-CoV-2 virus. The immune system of a person who has received the MMR 11 vaccine, recognizes the SARS-CoV-2 virus, because of that similarity to the other viruses, and attacks the SARS virus. Has your organization become aware of this research, and if so, will you address it, in a video?",
