I had actually been watching his Med Cram videos for years prior to meeting him in person at the bedside of my aunt. It was a serendipitous moment to know that this wonderful doctor lives and practices in my neck of the woods. My aunt fought valiantly but the infection was too powerful for her to prevail. After my aunt passed I had interaction with Dr Seheult\u2019s office for paper work. And he was always efficient and diligent even then. God bless this guy.",
