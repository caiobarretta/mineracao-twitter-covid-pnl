        "textDisplay": "Wow, this is one of THE BEST vids I have watched on Covid.  Granted I'm a noob in all this, but false Covid tests have bothered me and they create a doubt in me (and others) about logic and medicine.  But this was very easy to follow when you explained it with a simple use-case (as yourself), and the way you explained it, has helped me trust in logic and science.  Thanks very much for this vid, and would so much love if you make more vids on the Immune System theory, Th1/Th2/Innate dominance/components, how various simple ailments, nasal congestion, rhinitus, chilblains, mast cell disorder etc, they work (or atleast theorized to work) in terms of immune system components (TH cell types, Neutrophils, Macrophages, Mast etc).",
