They mostly die off after a certain period of time if there is no infection. However, memory cells which are also part of our immune bodies store information about each pathogen they encounter. Once they \"see\" it again, they send a chemical signal to the rest of the immune system which begins to produce necessary antibodies to combat that specific pathogen. So antibodies do disappear with time, but it does not mean that our bodies are unprepared for a subsequent infection by the same pathogen. \n\n\r\n\r\nWith influenza viruses, the problem is that they mutate too quickly to the point where our bodies stop recognising them, but you remain virtually immune to the same strain. There is a certain concern that SARS-Cov-2 might turn into a rapidly mutating virus, just like influenza viruses are. If it happens, we will likely need vaccine shots each time a new strain appears as it currently happens with the flu.",
