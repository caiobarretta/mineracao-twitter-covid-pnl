        "textDisplay": "Dr. Seheult, I liked your cautious statement at 4:07 about the possibility of the DNA to enter the host genome (\"according to scientists at AstraZeneca, it does not get incorporated into the host genome\"). The more I read about adenovirus-based viral vector vaccines, the more I encounter the issue precisely of the viral DNA integrating into the host DNA and disrupting normal cell function. I was skeptical of the mRNA vaccines at first, but it seems that  these first generation vaccines offer us the choice between potential autoimmunity and potential cancers down the road.  BTW, I am NOT an antivaxxer, I vaccinate my children, believe in the usefulness of vaccination for public health, and am ready to take a well-tested vaccine. I do however worry when the information we receive is carefully photoshopped, although I understand the public health needs of governments to tackle the pandemic fast and without lockdowns.  :(",
