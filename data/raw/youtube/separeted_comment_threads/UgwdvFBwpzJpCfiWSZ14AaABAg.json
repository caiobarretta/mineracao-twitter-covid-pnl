        "textDisplay": "I believe there are options for prevention and treatment that entail two possible approaches: We know the primary avenue of attack are the lungs, and once in, they attach by means of the spicules or \"spikes\". Their primary target or \"receptor\" are the ACE-2 or angiotensin-converting enzymes, same  as that of SARS-CoV, on the epithelial cells of the lungs.  Right there is one strategy for a form of intervention using nebulized or detached bonding receptors, akin to chelators or in fact serpins, serine protease inhibitors. \n\nBeside Remdesivir, Pyridone type inhibiting compound 13b will likely emerge as promising along these lines within the body. This compound disables the sars-cov-2 cleavage enzyme on the attachment spikes. Since this is a papain-like enzyme, the inhibitor will not affect the human serine enzymes, like trypsin, amylase, etc.\n\nIt could be used externally as well to attach aerosolized virii and they'll be inactivated even if they are inhaled.\n\nAnother approach is in terms of direct digestion of the virus by hydrolases like amylase, trypsin,  chymotrypsin and lipase. Intramuscular injections of amylase and trypsin were proven to resolve malaria very effectively by Lambelle in the early part of the 20th c. The ratio of amylase to trypsin was 2:1, and was well tolerated. His paper is available as a pdf.  While malaria is not a virus, the process of infectant inhibition of native enzymes taxing the whole system is akin and the strategy of bolstering it is rational.\n\nIt is worthwhile to also research the potential of external nebulized colloidal silver in air systems and bound to fiber masks, as an effective means of external denaturing the virus. As for inhaled nebulized colloidals, I am not aware of its possible utility or risk one way or the other. \n\nPaper on Compound 13b:\n\nhttps://science.sciencemag.org/content/early/2020/03/20/science.abb3405.full\n\n\nFor structure of viral components, also see:\n\nhttps://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867420302622",
