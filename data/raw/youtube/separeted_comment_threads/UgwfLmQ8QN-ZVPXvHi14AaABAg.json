Proteins are usually 10 times smaller than the wavelength of the visible light.  Since X-rays have wavelengths 10 times smaller than visible light, they can be used to visualize protein structure, but it is all black and white and not colorized. From what i understand X-ray crystallography works on crystallization of the protein, i.e. crystal arrangement of the viral particle or spike protein, here movement is not allowed for accurate measurement of the atoms and the structure that they form.  so visualizing the virus binding and entry is not possible. Or even for electron microscopy, the specimen for observation is frozen allowing no movement.",
