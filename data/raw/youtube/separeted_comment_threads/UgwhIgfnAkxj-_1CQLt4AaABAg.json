They are known to be more contagious, but most don\u2019t require hospitalization or cause death. \nMy sister and her husband had it,, they are in thieir mid sixties. Had bad sore throat, low grade fever, night sweats, chills, sinus congestion. Her husband got it after her and then her daughter in her 30\u2019s Her husband has had chronic diabetes but did fine, watched his sugars. They took Quercitin, zinc, Vit D and Tylenol for fever. They were vaccinated. They all had about two days of the symptoms at their worst, which was tolerable and got better each day after that..It affects upper respiratory rather than the lungs. But elderly need to watch for complications. Many in my family got it. My mom is 87, was sick for a week, my dad is 91, also sick for a week They didn\u2019t get vaccinated, don\u2019t trust it,  They both had taken antibiotics during Covid to prevent sinus or secondary infection. My dad had to go to hospital for one night to get extra antibiotics for slight pneumonia. Was fine in 2 days after that. Another sister and her husband got it, same symptoms ,not terrible. Fatigue and fever she said would come in waves. At times would feel ok and she could throw in some laundry and when a wave came she had to lay down. My sister got a sinus infection after a week and had to get antibiotic. Some people have tested positive and didn\u2019t even know they had it, asymptomatic. People are getting it, but don\u2019t let the news scare you. This latest Covid is nothing like the Delta Covid. It is much milder right now in severity, They are good at gloom and doom and stating the worst that can happen\u201d Well, we could get a much more severe variant . We don\u2019t know\u201d.   EXACTLY! So stop saying there is a Covid Crisis every night! They want to perpetuate it. By the way, my 38 year old daughter , who has asthma , and was vaccinated x2 and her 1 1/2 year old daughter got it .,  so just use common sense precautions. \nShe was sick for a week, no complications , and the baby did very well. I haven\u2019t gotten Covid myself was vaccinated, but I will not get the booster. Drs are sayyid can lower your immunity to other illnesses. Because you response is always targeting the spike proteins to kill and your antibodies are trained to focus on only the spike proteins from Covid.",
