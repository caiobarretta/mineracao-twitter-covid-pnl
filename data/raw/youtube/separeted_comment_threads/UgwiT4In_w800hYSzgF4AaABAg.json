We are interacting with the world around us, and this energy leaves changes in our genes. Some of the changes have no effect at all to the outside and others do (think of cancerous tissues). While these changes could be lethal under certain conditions it can also lead to evolutionary advantages increasing ur survival. For example if a protein in ur body mutates and this would lead to a insensitivity to   higher co2 levels in the air. And the co2 would rise to a level where everyone else would die, than this helped you survive and this gene will be propagated through next generations.\nWith the virus its the same. The virus might have mutated multiple times leading to less infective versions or versions where stability is so bad that it couldn't assemble at all. But these of course would not end up being investigated by us ;) was this helpful? did i explain it clearly? \ud83d\ude04",
