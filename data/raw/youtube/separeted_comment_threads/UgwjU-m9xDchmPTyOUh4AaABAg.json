I know there ist a extendet workshop for the CoronaPhysical Material but here you talk about a wider range of materials. Especially the translucent rubber would be interesting to create with the new standard... BTW will be the corona material library updated to PhysicalMTL?",

On the Material Library, it will in fact be removed and all materials added to Cosmos, and the current plan would be for those to come in as Corona Physical Material. Of course, that is a plan, and we'll have to wait and see how the implementation actually goes. Thanks! Tom",
