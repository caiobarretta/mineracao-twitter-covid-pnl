I have stopped masking when I go into the gas station, grocery store ect. but, when the parking lot is full, and, it looks like the store is crowded, I do wear a mask. We have a tourist economy, with attractions that draw folks from all over the country, and, in summer our stores are full of tourists. I guess it all comes down to personal choice. I am 73, and, in reasonable health, if I do get covid, I will probably be okay.  We all have to do what we feel is right for each of us, if I lived in an area of high transmission, I might do things differently.",

It is getting up to triple digits here already, so we don't get to enjoy much time outside. Outside, I go maskless unless it is crowded like a street market. I have the CA Notify app, so if someone else also has the app, it will notify all possible exposed people if I test positive. I got an alert, but fortunately I had been wearing my mask and tested for 2 weeks. I didn't get it.
