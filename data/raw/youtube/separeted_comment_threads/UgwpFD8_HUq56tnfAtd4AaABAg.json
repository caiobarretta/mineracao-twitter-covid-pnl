It's not helped by fact that Chinese internet censorship has made all connections outside incredibly slow, remote support really doesn't work so well there. So that basically means much of Chinese industry is like a fly stuck in amber, left as it was in 2019. Every year that passes it becomes more and more of a problem and things are not getting better in respect to Chinese covid policies, authoritarianism and isolation problems.",
