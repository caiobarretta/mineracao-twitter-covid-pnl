        "textDisplay": "Question for Derrick:  as a vaccine trial member (2020-2022), could you explain why no one thanked us.  No media outlet, not you or DW. Cnn....we risked our lives ( were not sick like cancer patients) and have saved a thousand times the number of lives first responders have. Please explain how trials work, repeated hospital visits for blood draws, no PPE given, weekly reporting.  A good explanation of trials, healthcare workers & volunteers would go a long way to helping hesitant vaccination refusers cooperate, wouldn't it?  Will you do it?",
