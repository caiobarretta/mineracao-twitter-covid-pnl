        "textDisplay": "Very nice combination of techno and saxophone, sounds like an alto. I like this version of Rythem of the Night a lot. It changes just enough, that if a new voice were to sing this live, they would have to practice to get the new timing down. Excellent job! My new favorite version of this song. I really like the visual effects too. It's very balanced. Very nice job putting this together!",
