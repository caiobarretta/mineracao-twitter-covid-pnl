It's true that America has some fairly serious issues when it comes to healthcare, many of which the ACA was passed to address.  I have never met or heard of anyone who was turned away by a hospital...as a matter of fact, there is a requirement to treat, and that is one reason healthcare is administered free of charge to people who aren't even in the U.S. legally.  I have known people with disabilities and chronic conditions who got lifelong free medical insurance.  I know mentally challenged individuals who even receive some dental care free of charge. My father had cancer, and he had every bill covered through his employee, and through Medicare.  My mother had cancer, and almost all of her expenses, were covered by Medicare, and when she went under hospice, those bills were covered as well.  I know a woman who is widowed, and her daughter is special needs, and they are both covered completely.  My sister has MS, and she has some insurance through her husband, but for the rest she has additional coverage through the Healthcare Marketplace.  The biggest problem we have in the U.S. is the high pricing for medical treatment which has been allowed to get way out of control, as well as the cost of medical insurance, which government involvement has actually made worse by pushing out private insurance and eliminating competition.      As far as I'm concerned comparing the U.S. to smaller countries or other types of government is nonsensical and basically apples to oranges.  There are issues, and healthcare is ever evolving, but I get very tired of people bad mouthing my country, especially anyone who would ever dare to call it uncivilized and uncaring.",

Luckily her widowed husband (had qualifications but the only jobs where they lived were part-time because then they didn't have to provide benefits such as health insurance) was able to get a visa to move to Ireland, he had the qualifications and found an employer to sponsor him, plus his sister-in-law and her husband (from Texas) stood as sponsors.  Friends found him a house and arranged for a childminder so the kids had someone to mind them after school.  They are all doing well now (living in Ireland) and he has taken out Irish citizenship and is also in the process of renouncing his US citizenship (can't think why <s>).  He got a mortgage and bought a house, the kids are doing well at school - eldest has just sat Junior Cert and is now in transition year.  Two of them have inherited the same condition their mother died from but because they are receiving treatment they will live normal lives (somehow their mother's condition was never picked up as a kid buy my friend says they could only ever afford the very basic medical insurance when they were growing up (60 years ago now) and you only went to the doctor if you were really ill, couldn't afford it otherwise, their dad wasn't in a well paid job) which will be free for life.  The eldest is hoping to follow his uncle into medicine and become a doctor and go into researching the condition his mother had as well as other liver conditions.  She would be very proud of the child.\nIf you look on social media you will find that my friend's sister is far from being the only one left to die because they couldn't afford medical insurance/visits to the doctor/prescriptions, and the biggest cause of bankruptcies in the US each year is medical debt.  Luckily I have ALWAYS lived in countries which recognise that the right to free-at-point-of-service/affordable medical care is a BASIC HUMAN RIGHT, something that even really poor countries like Armenia, China, India, many in Africa etc etc also recognise.  Just not the US but that is their loss (that and their now dead or bankrupt citizens) and I don't particularly care.  It is just that THIS particular incident of medical ''I don't give a toss, if you can't pay then I won't treat you'' hit home because it was the SISTER of a FRIEND who was left to die.  Luckily her surviving family managed to escape to a civilised, caring, country.",
