So i removed the tamp and put it back on real quick because a foam was getting released from the tip. So I dropped the foams on the test. It\u2019s negative. It seems that firstly The tamp should not be pushed too far or it needs an oxygen? On my husbands test there was also foam but Ican\u2019t remember how it really happened. I onky remember that I waited for a bot more and then squeezed. My husband\u2019s was positive. It was done on the 1st January. Mine is negative now.",
