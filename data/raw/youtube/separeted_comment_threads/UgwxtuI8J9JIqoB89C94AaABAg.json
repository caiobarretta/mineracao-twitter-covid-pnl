        "textDisplay": "I would like to say this video and the professor explanation is more than perfect. I am a doctor and I\u2019d like to add my story here. I had all this mechanism and at the end I got ARDS(chest pain and difficulty in breathing) and I was on vent and inotropes. All my chest X-ray was like white clouds, I got Covid-19 with the first sign and symptoms are abdominal pain , tenderness in abdomen , loss of appetite, vomit and then severe headache with high grade fever, PLZ note: many doctors confuse it with acute appendicitis and it\u2019s clinical picture is like that but actually no because in Acute appendicitis there\u2019s no high grade fever like 103 F\u2022 or 104F\u2022c most important thing you should know there\u2019ll be itchy viral rash and some doctors miss it with drug reaction but actually it\u2019s typical Presentation of Covid and maybe you\u2019ll also get hand and foot syndrome. Severity goes on and I got ARDS( difficult in breathing) then I was on vent and some positive inotropes to get my normal BP. Thanks to God it took like one month in ICU to recovery fully but it\u2019s steady. I wasn\u2019t expecting that I\u2019ll get second life but I\u2019m grateful to my God , Doctors and all family members sincere prayers. One thing I want to add here it Covid is very different in everyone I even didn\u2019t had any cough. So don\u2019t wait for cough if you develop any sign do directly PCR and Covid SARS -2 antibodies test. Most important is supportive care and to maintain oxygen saturation, BP and some main vitals and low the D-Dimers etc . The rest of imbalances will get recover soon as some antiviral drugs recommended by WHO which weakens or break the proteins of the virus. This is my own story and now I\u2019m like normal person got recovered totally so no worries be strong and everything will be fine.",
