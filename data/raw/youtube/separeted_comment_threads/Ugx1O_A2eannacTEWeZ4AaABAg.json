        "textDisplay": "This is phenomenal idk and idc where the virus came from. I just hope we all stay safe, sanitary, and  survive together coming together as a species to cure this pandemic.\nI'm looking at this with all perspectives and possibilities possible. This can cause some panic and fight or flight instincts however no one would wish this upon there worst enemy because of how it spreads. So is it also possible that we as a species are seeing natural evolution in an unnatural format like a new evolutionary break that boggles the mind and intimidates us all as a species causing those fight or flight instincts?... so please keep this into consideration even though the source could have incubated the evolution by accidentally created a controlled habitat for incubation. I dont think anyone is liable for this because it is hurt us ALL, doesnt discriminate on Nationality, Race, Age, Gender, and etc. It targets HUMAN DNA so....please be safe, take care, be sanitary, and help each other by keeping distance, sanitization of ones self will be key. Sanitization is rulling out all possibilities of how it spreads so wear a mask incase your spreading it through breathing, coughing, & sneezing. Since we dont show symptoms the reality is we all could already be infected and should be treated as so please wear a mask if your in public. Sanitization of mask, hands, clothing, and ones self should also be accounted for if your mask is disposable then please do such in the correct format, if it's something like a repeater treat your hands remove mask, sanitize mask with high grade isopropyl alchohol of a 60%+ grade. I hope your all taking the right steps to keep you and your loved ones safe.",
