        "textDisplay": "@TheLoneJourney My mothers' clan system is responsible for the King James Holy Bible in English. It was published so other countries could translate it into their own language to see what Jesus of Nazareth said, nothing about sending your best looking boys to Rome. We invented the encyclopedia, the Encyclopedia Britannica, to show the people of Europe that the peoples of the \"new world\" weren't just running dogs without language or prayer, how empire builders described them. The Merriam-Webster English dictionary was also published to help define the prophesied global language. Americans have Webster for a dictionary but he's not the same one. There is a history in the Holy Bible that isn't taught in North America that I could describe. The United States uses a Holy Roman Empire, or Vatican, version of historical events. The Lincoln Memorial is a copy of a Roman Empire temple for a god. Here's a question to test your Holy Bible understanding. If our eyes are the windows to our souls, why, in the entire New Testament, doesn't it tell you what happened when you looked into the eyes of Jesus of Nazareth. I will reply to any comment you may make. As a reward I'll tell you where the language of the Garden of Eden is still spoken.",
