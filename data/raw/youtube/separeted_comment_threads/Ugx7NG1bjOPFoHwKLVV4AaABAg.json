This video touches on the differences, but is it possible to make one that focuses on how to convert our old legacy materials accurately into the new Physical ones? (e.g. what is the new equivalent of Refl. gloss?)",

Meantime, check the helpdesk where there are shorter, more specific videos that may help, and you can always post over on the forums too for help in specific cases (do note that if a material was not physically realistic in any other material, including the Legacy, it may be impossible to tell how it should be converted automatically to the Physical Material, so automatic conversion may not always be possible). https://forum.corona-renderer.com/index.php?topic=33253.0 would be the thread for conversion questions, issues, etc. Thanks!
