Very difficult to otherwise know when you have no medical background. \n\nI have a question which is \nI suffer with auto immune disease chronic inflammation and have had a fair few cases of pneumonia and other infections on one occasion resulting in sepsis. Very recently almost nearly got to that stage. I commonly have a low BP anywhere around 80/90 over 50/60. I have been told this is not good but not too sure why. Is this indicative or organ failure (Allah forbid) or anything else I'm not sure of?",
