For me this is a very low number of deaths compared to the amount of people who I actually infected. I look at in a positive light. If it wasn't for me infecting these people,science wouldn't have had multiple people to conduct medical trials on. I look at it realistically and factually. I saved many,many lives. I'm proud to have done my part and contribute to SARS research",
