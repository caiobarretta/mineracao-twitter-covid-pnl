Anyways, Prof, you know that this is not a standard test at all. The Q-tip swab or whatever they are doing for PCR Test, the amount of stuff you get into the Q-tip is not standardized. So let assume in your sample, the amount of stuff collected is 1/4th, that means your CT value should have to be then 36.7. Or if you got amount of sample on Q-tip 8 times more, then the CT value would  be 31.7. That's why this PCR Test is bullshit, bogues, and I can't believe how so many scientists are not voicing enough.. and simply keep mum against all bullshit narratives shoved into people's faces by these MSM, TVs, WHO, CDC, NIH, NHS.. this is criminal act  they are engaging to cause massive hardships upon the population and torturing this.",
