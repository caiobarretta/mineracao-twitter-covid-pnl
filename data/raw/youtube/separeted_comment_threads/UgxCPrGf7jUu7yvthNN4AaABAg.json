        "textDisplay": "I wonder.... Does the release of co2 into the alveoli displace the oxygen in the alveoli, forcing it under pressure into the capillaries? If this is true, when holding your breathe do we see an increase of co2 in the blood stream because we are reabsorbing co2 from within the alveoli or from buildup without exhaust?  Or...  is the oxygen somehow simply absorbed? If absorbed, how? Is the release of co2 causing an effect like squeezing a sponge before it can absorb a liquid? Ill ponder.",
