I have helped many of the babies when the cats got hold of them, fixed them up, cared for them, let them sleep/rest in my jersey and placed them back in their roosts when they were healthy. They are an incredibly smart species with extremely high family bonds. Never ever ever have I ever been bitten, infected or whatever bs they are trying to spin to victimize and blame this poor species.",

        "textDisplay": "@Richard Cogbill Thank you for your message. I am a biologist and Conservationist. When you live in Africa then you will always be surrounded by wildlife, if you don't live in the cities and big towns. In my garden alone I have more than 50 species of various wildlife. Some of the world's most venomous snakes come through here, I am also a qualified snake handler. We have lived this way from the beginning of time. It is my knowledge that empowers me to act rationally. These bat families are so connected that the mother knows when the baby is injured even before me and comes in feverish search for her young, flying continuously through the house to get my attention. Then I know and she actually flies over the general area, then I search and find them under the desk, in the crevice of the curtain etc. When I put the baby back, she will afterwards gently come fluttering in to say thank you, before zipping out. As for being scared of illness, for instance we have bat eared foxes that live all around the town, they are carriers of rabies, our mountain has the highest density of leopard, we have large troops of baboons. There are those who live in fear and kill and maim these poor animals who would 99.9% of the time not do anything to humans unless provoked and threatened. In my almost 20 years as  a biologist and Conservationist I have worked with many dangerous species, obviously you have to be extremely cautious, but sometimes when they are injured you have to help. It is our role as stewards on this Earth to care for creation. There are various barriers to stop their diseases from getting to humans. One of the most practical things are to only eat specific meats and plants and to know the difference. South Africa have very good scientists and researchers  and I'm pretty sure that America doest carry the same Africa knowledge base as it is focused on your continent. Bats are mammals and thus of sentient intelligence, capable of caring for their young and teaching them. My original comment is because it was reported that all of a sudden after millions of years, SA bats have now been identified as carriers and through all this time of living with them where nothing has happened, now we need to be concerned. I am just here to say that it is not the truth.",
