        "textDisplay": "Wind is a good thing which will probably dilute the potential viruses you're inhaling to a very great extent so that the potential for you getting infected is practically zero. Of course droplets can spread with the wind many meters, but the chance that the one droplet maybe hitting you will cause an infection would be more theoretical than anything, I think. And I haven't heard that wind is a climatic risk factor in these instances.\n\n\nSocial distancing (2m) and wearing face masks when out in public, and being vigilant about what you're touching and not touching your face, would be measures good enough to prevent infection for the vast majority of the public, I think. Even if you inhaled one virus, that would also translate to a chance of getting infected practically zero. So I wouldn't worry about that, especially if your neighbour is asymptomatic, and if he is carrying the infection he would shed small viral loads. \n\n\nI hope I'm making sense. My personal views of course. I don't think you will find a study that answers your question specifically.",
