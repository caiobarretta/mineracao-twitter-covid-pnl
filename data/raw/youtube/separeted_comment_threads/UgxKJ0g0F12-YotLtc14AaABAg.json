        "textDisplay": "I think now is a great time for the Global Line to be drawn. Nations who have tenuous relationships need to come to agreements. Imperialism needs to be the cornerstone of these discussions. If you intend on growing your country geographically or \"reclaiming territories\", there cannot be inclusion with dialogues like that unless the target state agrees without influence. Those states seeking territorial / cultural gains will be taxed, tariffs will be imposed, and their global influence will systemically be reduced to nothing if they continue to exert pressure on culturally distinct regions that are not their own. Do the calculus and then come back to the rest of the world with a better attitude. If places want to claim independence, there needs to be a better system that allows for those excluded in that discussion to be heard. Racism, imperialism, and greed cannot define us when the human experiment is over. We need to find unity somehow. We need to find some semblance of fulfillment and happiness together. It cannot be taken from one another like land.",
