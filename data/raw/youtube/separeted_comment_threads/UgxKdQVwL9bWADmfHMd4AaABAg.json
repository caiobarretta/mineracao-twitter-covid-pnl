They were all vaxxed and boosted, and didn't require medical attention, but they still said it was no fun.  They were all sick for at least ten days, and are still recovering weeks later.  My daughter makes her living focusing with her brain, and she just couldn't do that during the first ten days or she got a severe headache.  She still gets brain fog if she concentrates too long.  Does this sound like the common cold to you?  Over one million dead.  Does that sound like the common cold to you.  And it's not like getting COVID will make you permanently immune.  You can get it again and again and again.",
