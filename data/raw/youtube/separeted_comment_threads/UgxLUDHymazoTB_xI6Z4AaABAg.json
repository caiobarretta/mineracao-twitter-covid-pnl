        "textDisplay": "I and my husband both had Covid with fever, low oxygen level.  My pharmacist adviced us to take 100,000 IU D3 daily for five days. When my husband\u2019s oxygen went to 87 he took another 100,000 and within two hours his oxygen went up. I believe vitamin D3 kept us out of the hospital.",
