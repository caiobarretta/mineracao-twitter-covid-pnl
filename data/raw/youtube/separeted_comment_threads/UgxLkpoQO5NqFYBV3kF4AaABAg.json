So with the new Physical Material the idea is that you're creating materials in a more physically correct way and arbitrarily putting in a map to control the reflection intensity is ... Not so correct.\n\nTo that end you can achieve similar control in a more physically correct way by plugging in the proper roughness / glossiness map where you can control how \"diffuse\" certain parts of the material are - and if they are really diffuse then the reflections will look dimmer.\n\nThat said if you want to use reflection maps with the Specular workflow in mind then going under the \"Advanced\" tab in the new Physical Material and selecting \"Disney Specular\" in there might be what you want.\n\nIn any case we'd suggest hopping over to our forums (https://forum.corona-renderer.com/index.php) where you can open up a thread and we can discuss things in even more detail.\nNejc",
