        "textDisplay": "Western countries didn't suffer from Covid because of a laissez-faire approach. The entire world has suffered and will continue to suffer because of a too restrictive approach. \n\nChina didn't have deaths in the low thousands. Especially if you count deaths the way they were counted in the US. The covid death total in the US would be much lower if they counted the deaths the way they do for influenza. And China lies about anything it can get away with. Hubei province itself probably had tens if not hundreds of thousands of deaths. Other places were not so seriously hit by covid, though there were more than just a few thousand deaths in China outside Hubei, but you'll never find out the true cost of the covid policy. I am convinced that a friend of mine in China ended up dropping out of college, landing in a mental hospital for a time, and cutting her veins a few times because of the covid lockdowns. I believe it was the stresses and disruptions of the covid lockdown restrictions that drove her that far. She's doing much better now since they were let up. We will be dealing with similar lifelong problems due even to the lesser disruptions to health and education we've created in the West. And if there's an area where we've been a bit laissez-faire it's that.",
