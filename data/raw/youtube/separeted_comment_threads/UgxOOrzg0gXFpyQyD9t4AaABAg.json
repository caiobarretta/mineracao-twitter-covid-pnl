        "textDisplay": "@Tomas Hull maybe I\u2019ve explained wrong but I was talking about a time eons ago when there was only single cell organisms on earth. \n\nNot me just research. \ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nProkaryotic cells (like bacteria) are very simple cells. They lack a nucleus, sometimes called the control center of the cell. In prokaryotic (PRO-care-ee-ought-ick) cells, the genetic material or DNA is loose inside and is made of a single loop. The loop is called a plasmid. There are few, if any, organelles, and none are bound by cell membranes. The name prokaryote comes from a Greek word meaning \"before nuclei.\" They are the oldest cells on Earth. These cells divide by simple fission. One cell splits into two identical cells. The germs that make us sick are prokaryotic cells.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t say the nucleus was separate at one time?\nBut we did go from single cell organisms to multicellular organisms.. how when ALL LIFE ON EARTH WAS SINGLE CELL AT ONE POINT.\n\nAnd I could be wrong on this but I swear I watch a documentary on this one time.\nWe humans don\u2019t know how the nucleus came about or it could be the Organelles?? \n\n\nAlso found this and I\u2019m sure it\u2019s more me not explaining myself right AT ALL as this is so difficult and amazing how cells actually work\nBut hopefully it\u2019ll show you I\u2019m not confused. \nConceding I didn\u2019t explain myself well\ud83d\ude4f\ud83c\udffe\n\nThis is what I meant.....\n\nNote that eukaryotic cells likely evolved from a symbiotic relationship between two prokaryotic cells, whereby one set of prokaryotic DNA eventually became separated by a nuclear envelope and formed a nucleus.

They lack a nucleus, sometimes called the control center of the cell. In prokaryotic (PRO-care-ee-ought-ick) cells, the genetic material or DNA is loose inside and is made of a single loop. The loop is called a plasmid. There are few, if any, organelles, and none are bound by cell membranes.
