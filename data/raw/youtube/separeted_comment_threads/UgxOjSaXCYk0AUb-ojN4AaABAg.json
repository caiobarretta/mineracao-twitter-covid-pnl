        "textDisplay": "I had Covid in March 2020. I stocked up on food, cigars and alcohol before coming down with the virus. I didn't take it very seriously which I should have. While in quarantine all I did was smoke cigars and consume lots of alcohol out of sheer boredom. Only symptoms I had was slight fever that lasted 2 days and loss of taste and smell which lasted a week. Here I am a year later doin' fine. I know everyone's symptoms can vary. I was incredibly lucky to say the least and thankful it wasn't severe.",
