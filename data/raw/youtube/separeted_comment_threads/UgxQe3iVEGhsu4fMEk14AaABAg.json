        "textDisplay": "Such a short term benefit should not overlook the research that has implicated long term Fluvoxamine as a dementia risk. Dr. Campbell also sung the praises of Fluvoxamine without mentioning the dementia aspect. There is far too much casual antidepressant use in society akin to the overuse of antibiotics. When considering a new repurposed drug the risk/benefit analysis needs to include whether or not an already existing therapeutic is safer and more effective. That indeed is the case as Ivermectin seems superior on all counts, most notably a much better safety profile. So why consider a drug that messes with brain chemistry when there's a better alternative? This doesn't make a lot of sense.",
