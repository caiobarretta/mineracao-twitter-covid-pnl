Therefore we have to take measurements and conduct experiments to get to a hypothesis like in this video - it's hard work - and some things are unknown - for example how exactly the spike gets into the host cell membrane. Luckily, there was a lot of reserach before the COVID-19 pandemic on the fundamentals for this process, so we can build on that research now!",
