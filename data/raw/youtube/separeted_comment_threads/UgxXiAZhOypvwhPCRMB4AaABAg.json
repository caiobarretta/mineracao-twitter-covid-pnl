They did intake blood testing, nasal swab and questionnaires for not only 70+ players per team, but coaches, training, medical, support staff, business staff, communication staff, independent media, essentially anyone that would be going in and out of the building. That\u2019s somewhere in the neighborhood of 200-300 people for each of the 32 teams, plus referees and league staff. That\u2019s at the very least 6,000 people of different races, ages, genders, physical condition, etc.\n2. They\u2019ve been testing all of these people on a daily basis for 5 months & these aren\u2019t the \u201cquick tests\u201d, they all go to a network of labs throughout the country to be processed. Imagine the cost alone on administering & processing, what has to be over a million tests at this point?\n3. They\u2019ve monitored every case, down to genome testing, to establish if 2 players on the same team caught the virus from each other or if they each contracted it from separate sources.\n4. Everyone also wears tracking bracelets when they are in the building.\n\nThey NFL has to have a good idea of:\n1. The percentage of asymptomatic cases.\n2. Percentage of Mild cases.\n3. Percentage of serious cases.\n4. Possible genetic markers & impact.\n5. Percentage of people who contracted the virus more than once, and any differences between those contractions.\n6. More detailed Incubation period information.\n7. More detailed contagious period information.\n8. I believe they still have zero transmissions from \u201con field play, from team to team\u201d, transmissions have happened in the locker rooms &/or on teams own sidelines.\n9. Treatment results.\n10. Doctors got to investigate known positive cases prior to any symptoms developing.\n\nI haven\u2019t heard anyone mention if these results will be published by the NFL Doctors who are collecting, conducting and evaluating all of this information?\nI really hope they do, because the amount of money and circumstances to get this kind of information from a trial is nearly impossible for anyone else to replicate, especially for the regular medical community who\u2019s resources & focus has to be on treating the most severe cases.",
