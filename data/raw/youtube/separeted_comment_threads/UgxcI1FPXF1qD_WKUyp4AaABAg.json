Changing the exposure and highlight compression should be all that's needed - however, we'd need more info, such as examples of the results you are getting, with some screenshots of the UI for the settings you were using, maybe the scene itself, and of course none of that is possible on YouTube Comments. Head to the forums though, where such things are possible, and we and the community at large will be happy to help! https://forum.corona-renderer.com/index.php Thanks! Tom",
