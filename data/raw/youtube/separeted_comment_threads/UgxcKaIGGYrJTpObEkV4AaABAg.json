In a normal environment, the one we used to live in and get infected by Influenza, for example, CFR is probably closer to 0.8-1%. Sure, not the initial 5%, that value was too high due to the lack of testing. It's hard to get now an estimate. Also, it seems that several lower doses in a short period of time have a cumulative effect and can trigger the symptoms, while several lower doses in a longer period of time can build a humoral immunity (antibodies) in a totally asymptomatic manner. Anyway, your observation remains, I landed midway into the clip and I said WTF!\nAlso, a note, I think it's important to describe how the virus hijacks the ribosomes to make more copies of itself. One reason is that Pfizer/BioNTech and Moderna vaccines are using a similar \"technique\" - mRNA. Another reason is that people are saying, \"yeah, we don't have yet an HIV vaccine and we have now, in less than 1 year, several SARS-CoV-2 vaccines! I don't believe that!\" HIV uses a different mechanism to hide (within the cell's DNA) and to make copies of itself.",
