        "textDisplay": "Wait.. Please correct me if I'm wrong. Clear coat is for the most part refractive and doesn't really absorb much of color. It's actually the coats underneath, that absorb specific light waves and define a color. That's what I remember, how these things were thought in physics class?\nSo adding the absorbed color into the clearcoat section, doesn't make any sense to me from the physical correctness point of view? Or is this meant for colored metals or something like this, because they have colored reflection...thanks in advance for your answers.",

        "textDisplay": "Clearcoat is like a layer of extra material painted over a surface - just like a varnish. And just like a varnish, that can indeed have absorption, e.g. a dark brown all the way through to crystal clear, depending on the material being used as the coat. If you paint over a light wood with a heavy dark brown varnish, then all aspects of the light wood (its diffuse and its reflection etc) will become colored by how the top layer absorbs light - which is what happens here.\n\nClearcoat is not required for colored metals, anything set to Metal has its color controls (non-Metals always reflect white, so there are no color controls for reflection there... unless you add a clearcoat on top, again like the wood, the reflection of light there would be white, unless that is passing through a colored varnish).\n\nThanks!\n  Tom",
