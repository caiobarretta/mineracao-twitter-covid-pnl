        "textDisplay": "It's Super Fascinating to go back and look at archival footage of people talking about Coronavirus before COVID-19. \r\nYou wouldn't expect it, but if SARS-CoV-2 (COVID-19) was more deadly, then it would very likely result in less deaths, and previous outbreaks prove that.\r\nI think looking back at previous outbreaks proves the fact that a more \"dangerous\" (higher fatality rate) strain with more noticeable symptoms is actually better for containing it. \r\nMost people refer to the SARS 2002-04 outbreak, as it's the most well known and had a huge impact. Maybe you might get some bits and pieces here and there about MERS, especially because there is still an effect to this day. Putting them side by side, you can clearly see a trend: \r\n\r\n----\r\nThe worst of the Orthocoronavirinae outbreaks pre-2019 was of course the 2002 Coronavirus Outbreak. SARS-CoV-1 left 8100 people infected with 810 deaths. That's only a 10% fatality rate, and with less symptoms it's clear to see how that might have caused such a spike in cases.\r\nLess well known and less problematic was the several MERS outbreaks: The worst of which occurred in 2012 with nearly 2600 cases and about 900 deaths which accounts for a roughly 34.6% FR. The Next outbreaks were much less bad with the 2015 Outbreak having 186 cases 36 deaths, which means but a pretty significant 19.4% FR. And lastly, we have our most recent 2018 Outbreak with only 193 cases with 56 deaths meaning a much more significant 29.0% FR. \r\nObviously SARS-CoV-2 is the most well known and most well-researched considering we're all living through it, but it also has a STAGGERINGLY LOW Fatality Rate, with only ~2.17% of those who getting infecting dying. It\u2019s ease of spread is what likely contributed the most to it\u2019s 137.2 Million cases worldwide, and it\u2019s almost 3 Million deaths.\r\n----\r\nTo put all of that side by side:\r\n2002 Outbreak: 8100 Cases, 810 Deaths, 10.0% Fatality Rate\r\n2012 Outbreak: 2600 Cases, 900 Deaths, 34.6% Fatality Rate\r\n2015 Outbreak: 186 Cases, 36 Deaths, 19.4% Fatality Rate\r\n2018 Outbreak: 193 Cases, 56 Deaths, 29.0% Fatality Rate\r\n2019 Outbreak: 137,200,000 Cases, 2,956,000 Deaths, 2.17% Fatality Rate\n\n\r\n\r\nA direct comparison was made between CoV-1 and CoV-2, and one of the more notable parts was this: \r\n\"Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours and on surfaces up to days (depending on the inoculum shed).\"\r\nCheck out the Article here, there's actually a lot of interesting similarities: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7121658/ \r\n----\r\nNow keep in Mind, SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV (also know as EMC/12) are NOT the same thing. Though they are obviously very similar considering that they are both Coronaviruses under the same Betacoronavirus Genus, but SARS is part of the Sarbecovirus Subgenus, whereas MERS is part of the Merbecovirus. This means they attach in different ways. SARS enters the host cell by binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2). On the other hand, MERS enters its host cell by binding to the DPP4 receptor. The other Coronaviruses that affect humans (HCoV-229E, HCoV-NL63, HCoV-OC43, and HCoV-HKU1) haven\u2019t had any major notable outbreaks, though 229E has been known to be one of the Viruses responsible for the common cold, but obviously not the only one.\r\n\r\nThis should go without saying, but just in case it isn\u2019t obvious, the Zika Virus, Western African Ebola Virus, and H1N1 Influenza Virus, are OBVIOUSLY not Coronaviruses, and the actual effects should not be compared because they transform, spread, and mutate in completely different ways, and thus, preventative measures are not comparable. \r\n------\r\nThe main point I\u2019m trying to make is that the data shows, yes, a more deadly virus will very likely result in less deaths when it comes to Coronavirus. I\u2019m unaware if the same applies to other viruses, but looking at Ebola, it\u2019s possible that this might not be the case. And yes, I know that the Mortality Rate doesn't affect how easily the virus can spread. If a dangerous virus is able to spread fast enough it will leave millions dead, but the reaction from Governments and Organizations around the world who have to deal with this stuff would always be more cautious during a more dangerous outbreak. No doubt that actions from Governments, most notably China, have caused this pandemic to be such a problem, and if different decisions were made, especially with censorship of information, this probably wouldn't have been as bad, kind of like how MERS wasn't too bad. (it was still bad, just not as bad as either of the SARS outbreaks)\n\nI also think part of it has to do with the day-to-day human interactions as well. Billions of people are not taking this outbreak seriously, with varying levels of justification and results. A large portion of the population, including friends I personally know, are still convinced that all of this is fake, and will continue to ignore pretty much all of the evidence you throw at them. I know, it drives me crazy too. A higher will very likley change those people's mind, make them think more carefully. On top of that, a higher death rate means less people going around spreading the virus, unknowlingly or not. Of course, this is all speculation on my part, but I think that it's justified based off of the information I was able to gather.\n\n\r\nIf I were to put all of the articles I used as references, it would be just as long as my message itself, so instead, I will just put the three most important Wikipedia articles on the topic, and you can continue to do further research, or even fact check me on things I got wrong (I\u2019m not a microbiologist, though I did spend some time in biology class in College but that hardly means much, I just did some research is all)\n\n\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coronaviridae\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Severe_acute_respiratory_syndrome_coronavirus\r\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_East_respiratory_syndrome%E2%80%93related_coronavirus",
