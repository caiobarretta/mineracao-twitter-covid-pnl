Such people are just vulnerable to illnesses in general. An example: Old people are the biggest group that are vulnerable to covid. But the thing is... Old people are just vulnerable to MANY THINGS. Even falling on the ground can be fatal to an old person. So, you can't say therefore covid is dangerous. It just isn't.\n\nThe only thing that makes covid stand out is how fast and easy it can spread. Which automatically makes the numbers higher, it's only common sense. It has nothing to do with 'how dangerous' it is. It just isn't dangerous. SCIENCE shows that we have good immunity against covid-19. ESPECIALLY after taking vaccins.",
