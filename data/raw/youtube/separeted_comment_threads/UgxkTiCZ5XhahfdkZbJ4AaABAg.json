        "textDisplay": "Studies of Doctors and Nurses across the globe, who routinely come in contact with several variant covid-19 strains, on a daily basis, have shown that people who maintain a VEGAN diet are 73% less likely to experience even mild or severe symptoms due to infection, and are even less likely to be infected in the first place. No apparent need for vegans to be vaccinated, but we are still ostracized and judged as \"anti-vaxxers\". It is unfair judgement.  I have not had flu or sickness in 5 years as vegan, and I feel fantastic. Do not judge me for not being experimentally \"vaccinated\", and I will \"try\" not to judge you for not being vegan. How many of you pro-\"vaxxers\" are willing to go vegan? That's what I thought.",
