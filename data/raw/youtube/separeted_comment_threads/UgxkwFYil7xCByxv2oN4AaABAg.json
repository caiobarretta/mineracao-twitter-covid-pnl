Because hospitals are the last resort, once you need medical help you have already failed to take care of yourself. Doctors are \"mending\" health and not preventing health problems in the future.\nSo I think that one great thing we should do is learn about how to take care of ourselves and have people in the healthcare system that can advise us on how to do that without tons of pills and expensive treatment.",
