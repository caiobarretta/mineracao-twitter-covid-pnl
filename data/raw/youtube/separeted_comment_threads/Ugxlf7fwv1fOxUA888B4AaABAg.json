Those \u201dhealthcare index\u201d rankings usually base their analysis on facts that tilts everything in the favour government healthcare while leaving out incredibly essential facts and hence are very biased and I don\u2019t trust them that easily. This is simply because the academia is so left-leaning in the Western world. Besides that, none of us Nordic countries(I am Finnish) could have anything close to the systems we have if it were not for the medical and technological innovation that comes primarily from the United States. We don\u2019t develop any of that because there is no incentives here to innovate because of really high taxes and the discouraging of entrepreneurship. Furthermore the systems are unsustainable and will eventually fall like a house of cards since the government can\u2019t keep loaning money forever and not pay back. That is also true of the United States as well. That is why the government everywhere must get out the way no matter how politically inconvenient that might be. People nowadays think free healthcare, free food, free housing, free education and so forth are \u201dhuman rights\u201d and that list just keeps expanding. It\u2019s nonsense and it might be 5 years or it might be 50 years until people realize that but it will come. And for the record, I am not praising the US healthcare system either, I think it is on the same road of destruction as we are.",
