If such a virus transfers from an animal to humans, they behave in a certain way, in which the infectivity slowly increases as more and more mutations happen to infect humans more easily. They would have also found some animals which were infected by this. Given how closely bats live in caves, surely they would have found one bat which had a very slightly modified version of this virus.",
