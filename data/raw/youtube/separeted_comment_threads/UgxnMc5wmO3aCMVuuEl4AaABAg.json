        "textDisplay": "@Archie Woosung As the doctor explains in the video the AstraZeneca endpoint for efficacy was actual testing (with a nasal swab) for the virus whereas the main efficacy endpoint for the Pfizer and Modena trials was symptoms of covid. \nAll these trials are very early in progress and in all three the results are interim and none are reported in peer reviewed journals with all the data. However I find it strange that Pfizer and Moderna would use symptoms of covid as the main endpoint for efficacy when its well understood that a number of people with covid infection have no symptoms (especially if under 40yrs of age) . \nI'm a retired research physician myself and in my opinion it really is too early to tell with certainty anything except that all three appear to be effective to a high degree. There are a number of other vaccines in trial as well using different biologic techniques and its quite likely that in the end the \"best\" approach will be to give everybody a mix of two or more vaccines.",
