He has also been vaccinated and boosted.  However, he eats out in restaurants fairly often.  He tested positive for Covid yesterday and is now on Paxlovid and quarantining but is still very sick.  He is sorry he believed that the virus was gone & it was OK to eat out.  I hope he gets past this and recovers!",
