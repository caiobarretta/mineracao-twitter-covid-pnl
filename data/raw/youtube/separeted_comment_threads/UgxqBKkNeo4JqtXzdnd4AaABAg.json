        "textDisplay": "@Daniel Manly There are some papers that show that:\n\n 1) SARS-COV-2 changes the cellular metabolism to more anaerobic glycolysis and to less oxidative phosphorylation in the mitochondria\n\n 2) the very same metabolic shift occurs in cancer and is known as the \"Warburg effect\"\n\n 3) there is a paper from Lew(is) Cantley I think from 2009 in which he shows that what this metabolic shift does is to let the cell use the glucose for rapidly creating building blocks for a new cell (like nucleic acids, amino acids, fatty acids...) rather than for energy.\nThis is what helps cancer cells to proliferate very rapidly.\n\n 4) So it seems that SARS-COV-2 changes the cellular metabolism and this helps it proliferate more rapidly, as a virus needs exactly the same building blocks as a cancer or even a normal cell for rapid proliferation.\n\n 5) now it has beed shown recently in some papers that sugar (by which I mean either fructose or sucrose - and sucrose metabolizes as 1/2 fructose + 1/2 glucose) triggers exactly the same metabolic shif (either directly or via uric acid).\n\n 6) so all in all, both SARS-COV-2 AND dietary sugar push the metabolism into the same direction and this seems to help SARS-COV-2 to replicate more rapidly. So it is reasonable to assume that dietary sugar \"boosts\" the severity of SARS-COV-2 by helping the virus replicate more rapidly.\n\nBut there is more to it and most probably all of those effects come together.\n\nIt has been shown that fructose leads to insulin resistance and hyperinsulinaemia and high insulin inhibits autophagy. And there was an (unpublished, sadly)\u00a0study showing that SARS-COV-2 also inhibits autophagy and that it helps it to once again replicate more rapidly. (The study was published only in preprint apparently because the study aimed at finding a medication which haven't succeed. There was a similar study by the same authors about MERS/SARS-1 which was published I think in Science some time before.)\n\nSo it seems that high insulin makes COVID-19 more sever. There is even one study showing exactly that. And just think of all the diabetic, obese patients with SARS-COV-2, patients with the metabolic syndrome. Oh, and did I mention that autophagy gets constantly less with age, too?\n\nAlso, it is well known that sugar in the diet makes the immune system \"lame\".\n\nSo a combination of metabolic syndrome (which dietary sugar heavily contributes to) with acute sugar intake and SARS-COV-2 makes the \"perfect\" storm.
