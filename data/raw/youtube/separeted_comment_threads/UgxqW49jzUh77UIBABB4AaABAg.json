Development of 3D models compared to sprite sheets or 2D graphics is significantly higher in cost and time.\nAnd yes, the ux/ui in Unity is nice, but not any better than Corona.  I would say they are tied in that regard.\nAs for developer community, while Unity has a large community, in my experience the Corona community is much more helpful.",
