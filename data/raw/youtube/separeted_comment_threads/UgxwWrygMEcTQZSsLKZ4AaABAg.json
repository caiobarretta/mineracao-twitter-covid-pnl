        "textDisplay": "Very amazing work. Thank you so much for putting all of the components in an easy to understand format. Have a question about RSV. I have pneumonia now, waiting for results (maybe 4 days?), my daughter and I had RSV 3 years ago. She had symptoms early (cough, fever, fatigue), but being 4, she did not meet test criteria. After almost 2 weeks of treating her at home, she started feeling better. Then I had a fever, chills, fatigue, productive cough. After 3 days, I went to my doctor, negative flu, negative strep, had pneumonia. Told them I definitely needed a covid test. It was very hard to get tested. Now I am waiting for results and don't know what the next step is. Any ideas? Quarantine, I have been.",
