Nurses taking care of Hep B patients often developed immunity with out getting sick much, if at all, as saliva delivers a much lower viral load.  The problem is with children because they don't have the immune system yet, and they become chronic for life if they get it too young.  I have also heard, you can get a really bad immune reaction from the vaccine if you already had viral Hep B before they stick you.",
