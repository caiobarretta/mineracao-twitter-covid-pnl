In many places is advised to NOT go to get tested if your symptoms are mild so the infected people could be double or triple and the mortality rate much lower. \nI saw studies and stats by countries that tested everyone like south Korea and is expected that the mortality rate would be 1% or less. 0.66%\n\nThis for sure changes from country to country as you say.",
