I read the Moderna and Pfizer emergency use authorization and the formula they are using to calculate efficacy does not take into account the percentage of the study group that was actually exposed to the virus. that seems a bit strange to calculate the effectiveness of a vaccine when you\u2019re not taking into account or removing from account those who never came in contact with the virus. please comment....",
