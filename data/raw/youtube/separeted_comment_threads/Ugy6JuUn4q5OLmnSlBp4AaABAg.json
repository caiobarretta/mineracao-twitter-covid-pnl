We must receive Sinless Jesus sincerely to be God's child(John 1:12).After we get saved by grace through faith in Christ, if we truly love the Lord Jesus Christ, then we will obey Jesus(John 14:15).  Mark 1:15 \"And saying, the time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God is at hand: Repent ye, and believe the gospel.\" Jesus said in John 14:15 \"If you love Me, keep My commandments. \"There's a real hell. It says in Revelation 21:8 \"But for the cowardly, & unbelieving, & abominable, & murderers, and immoral persons and sorcerers and idolaters and all liars, their part will be in the lake that burns with fire and brimstone...\" Please sincerely receive Holy Jesus & put your true faith and trust in Him today & please repent.  Will you have a Real encounter with Holy Lord Jesus and stay in a Genuine relationship with Him daily please?",
