The definition of severity is different for different people . The thing I am going to tell you is weird but a cure. It is my life time experience of pneumonia and inflammation. I have suffered the hellish pain of pneumonia and inflammation through out my life.  When antibiotics stopped working I followed this tip very strictly and it's been two years, I  won't face neither pneumonia nor inflammation, I have a very sensitive body and if I eat a tiny thing that is a little inflammatory, my body immediately tells me that  you  have eaten something wrong,if I eat two or three pieces of bread I got a body pain, if I eat an orange I got sneezing immediately and if I eat a vegetable, it takes me three to four days but my body tells me that it was inflammatory too, pneumonia made my body too sensitive so I have sorted out these foods and, I have been working on this theory for a long time, and it took me more than 20 years to sort out these foods . \nApply the following diet plan strictly for some days during covid 19 infection and you have no fear of any type of pneumonia and inflammation. A human body takes 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus and it is a natural way to avoid the over inflammation. \nNon - inflammatory food list \n1. All the meaty products [everything, like eggs,\u00a0 pork, beef, mutton, chicken, fish etc.(eat them  grilled or boiled or you can use pure mustard oil or pure butter clarified to cook them )] .\u00a0\n2. Wheat ( and all the products that are made from pure wheat, not biscuits, cookies or breads because they contain vegetables oil).\u00a0\n3. Gram, cheakpea( chana or kabuli chana).\u00a0Masoor dal. \n5. Green leaves like spinach, lettuce, etc.\u00a0 ( green leaves mustn't be sour, bitter or spicy ).\u00a0\n6. All the Dairy products (they must be made from pure animal milk like butter clarified,\u00a0 curd, cheese, fresh milk ).\u00a0\n7. Pure Mustard oil, turmeric powder, red chili powder , white sugar, sea salt, coriander powder and leaves, butter clarified.\u00a0\n8. Lemon and curd ( lemon and curd are non - inflammatory things\u00a0 but they act differently with different\u00a0 foods, with the suggested foods they never be a cause for inflammation).\u00a0\nIf someone\u00a0get affected with covid 19, he must avoid lemon for some days because he already would have eaten something that lemon acts as an inflammatory thing. But if the\u00a0patient would have been  eating  the suggested diet very strictly for more than 18 days\u00a0then he can add lemon\u00a0 in his regular diet it will never be inflammatory then. The patient has to apply this diet plan very very strictly because consumption of a single fruit,dry fruit, vegetable or vegetable oil, onion, garlic, ginger and all non suggested cereals , lentils and a little thing besides the suggested diet may affect the whole result, so apply this thing strictly for fifteen days and see the result by yourself. \nNote- feed your infants with mother milk or pure animal milk,( formula\u00a0 milk acts like a poison during the covid 19 infection because it contains vegetables oil.\n(if the patient follows this diet plan strictly his body acts over covid 19 like an animal body does, he may  get affected  but  never faces the worst, and he never be needed to be hospitalized ).\n(covid 19 is fetal for those patients whose body act overwhelmingly on covid 19, if  someone's body doesn't act overwhelmingly he never faces over inflammation  and it's nothing but a different sort of comman cold for him, if you follow this diet plan your body never act overwhelmingly on covid 19 believe me Our natural immune system is capable to neutralize this virus, but it needs time because a human body does take 15 days to produce antibodies against any virus, and it is not covid 19 that kills the patient directly but it is a cause for death. The thing that kills the patient, it is over        inflammation, because over inflammation destroyed our respiratory system and in lack of oxygen our whole system get destroyed and the  situation becomes dreadful ).,.,.,",
