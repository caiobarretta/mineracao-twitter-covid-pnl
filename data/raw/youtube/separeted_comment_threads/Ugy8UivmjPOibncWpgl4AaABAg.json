        "textDisplay": "Doctor, it's hard to fathom how this study shuts down ivermectin as ineffective when there are other studies that show it being very effective when dosed correctly and in the right infection cycle. This study, did it include the use of zinc in the HCQ as its function of an ionophore? If not that is counterproductive and if so then whatever happened to the data that zinc can shut down viral reproduction if used correctly and early? These studies with exact opposite results are confusing at best and frustrating to mystifying at worst. One has to wonder about confirmation bias or other factors because it's not coming off as logical.",
