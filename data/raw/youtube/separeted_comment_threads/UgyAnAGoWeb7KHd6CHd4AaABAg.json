As a note, you can install more than one version of Corona at once, making it possible to use, say, Corona 7 for your scenes and renders for clients, but Corona 6 for scenes you intend to sell, etc. Hope that helps!

Since it's legacy / deprecated, and should not be used, there's no way to convert back to it, or to save to the old version (as there is no reason to do so, the new material is better all round).
