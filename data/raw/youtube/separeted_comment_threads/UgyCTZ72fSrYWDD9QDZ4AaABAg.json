Judging from the comments, you need to have this on a constant repeat, til folks understand. \nHere in UK ct values not available on our Pillar 2 tests, which our brainless lot let influence our 'policy' ( aka blunders ) Really appreciate these informative presentations available to anyone. Great to have a trusted, specialist info stream amidst all the 'noise'.",
