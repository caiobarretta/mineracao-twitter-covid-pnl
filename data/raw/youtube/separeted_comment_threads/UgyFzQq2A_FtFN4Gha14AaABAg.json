        "textDisplay": "Again it seems that the specialist is perhaps conflating infection with symptoms. AFAIK, at least originally, what was assessed in terms of \"efficacy\" was efficacy in preventing symptoms, not infection. You'd have something like 95% of people who didn't require an ICU or any hospitalization, but who could have had moderate and mild disease, the milder, the more common. And even those who had no symptom whatsoever could still have had a completely asymptomatic infection, just like what happens with the non-vaccinated at some significant fraction of the time. AFAIK the prevention of infection itself (and potential transmission) was (or is currently being) only inferred more indirectly, with fewer new cases on the houses of people where someone was vaccinated and so forth. But even there perhaps there can be cases of new asymptomatic infections, with vaccinated people transmitting at lower doses and more likely causing asymptomatic infections at this level.",
