Seriously, you sound like you just started researching this after this latest pandemic. \nYou say \"Spanish flu was the major zoonotic disease outbreak from mammals in human history\"\nFirst, what the hell does that mean. Are you saying \"the only\"?? If so you are wrong. HIV has heritage in SIV in our closest primate relatives.
