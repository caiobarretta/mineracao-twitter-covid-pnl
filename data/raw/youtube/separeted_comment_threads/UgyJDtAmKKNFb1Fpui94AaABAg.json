The first explanation of symptoms and outcome that makes sense. \nI visited NYC (grew up there but hadn't been back in 30 years) about 6 weeks ago. I caught a cold, probably from riding the trains, etc. When I got back home Corona was all over the news and I started freaking out mentally. I went to Chinatown 2x to eat. But all I had was a cough and chest cold. I hope the people that are affected pull through OK.",
