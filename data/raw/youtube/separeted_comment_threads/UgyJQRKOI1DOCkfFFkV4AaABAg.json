Think about it this way, I would like to see the day were WoMD no longer exist and we can all get along and explore the universe rather then the petty conflicts and existential crises we're sealing with. I mean so many lives and resources are wasted on war and its sickening. Why do we divide ourselves on ideological line that in the bigger picture are just distraction? Why can't we make sure the needs of the many are met when we are in the age of abundance and wealth? The reason for that is our society (both western and eastern) don't value kindness and decency like it wealth and profit. Its the speed of which I suppose we are advancing as a \"intelligent\" species that we are likely to kill each other off while destroying our home before we decide to look after each other. A hypothetical example, what if all nations came together to eliminate war, poverty and/or prevent further global warming to make sure that we last the next fifty or so years. Currently we are not doing this to the extent that it needs to be done because it's not profitable enough for those who control our economies. Please excuse the now finished rant, general human stupidity is aggravating sometimes ^_^'",
