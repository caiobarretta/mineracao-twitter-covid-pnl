        "textDisplay": "@Silent_Stalker You say we need meat but it's interesting that there's communities of people eating plant based diets on islands such as Sardinia, Ikaria and Okinawa and they're the longest living people on earth, where living and working until they're 100+ is common. I understand some poor countries like Africa etc rely on cows milk for calories but they still allow the calf to drink what it needs and sure as hell don't have cruel factory farms and practices or treat those animals like they do the animals in factory farms where the majority of the meat you eat is produced. Also there is nothing in meat that you can't get from plants, they actually provide a healthier source of nutrients aswell as being better for the planet. And just so you know, most cows are supplemented with b12 via an injection so your meat is still being supplemented, and over half of the population is deficient in b12, its not a vegan thing so don't be afraid of supplements. You're ignorance is not always bliss, but knowledge is always power.",
