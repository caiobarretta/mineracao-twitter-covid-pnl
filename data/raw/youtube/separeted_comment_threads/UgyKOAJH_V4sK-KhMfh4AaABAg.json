It is up to all countries to protect themselves and whatever strategy to combat the pandemic. China is looking at the well-being of its people and saving life is of paramount importance. If it affect China\u2019s economy due to the lockdown, so be it. China is prepare to pay the price to keep the people safe from the pandemic. Different countries have different culture and different environment and different way in handling the pandemic.We are still in the pandemic crisis all over the world. It is up to the countries how best to managed the spread of the Omicron virus in the country. Many countries have given up and started coexisting with covid, but China has not abandoned its dynamic zero policy. Shanghai is a pilot city to implement a relatively loose control and the situation there is not as scary as the numbers show. Most people who tested positive have no symptoms and the fatality rate is far lower than regular flu. China is concerned about the protection of vulnerable populations during the outbreak. One of the critical indicators in evaluating if a country is doing an excellent job in epidemic prevention and control or not is whether the vulnerable population is well protected. The dynamic zero policy and the strategy of promoting booster shots are essential to the country that prioritizes and strengthens the protection of vulnerable populations. China mass testing in the pandemic shows the rise of Omicron virus and it shows in the data collected whereas the West stop testing the spread of the Omicron infection and no data has been collected or reported. The results differs differently between data collected on China mass testing and the West with no data and fatality in the statistics for the purpose of inferring proportions in a whole from those in a representative sample.\u00a0Quarantine is a measure of disease prevention in the midst of the pandemic.",
