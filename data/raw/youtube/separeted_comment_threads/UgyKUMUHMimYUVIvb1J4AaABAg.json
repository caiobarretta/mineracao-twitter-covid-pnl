The fact that so many working class people insist on scraping by in the largest cities (that they can't afford) instead of moving to a smaller one and having a good life, is the problem. I recently convinced my wife's sister to move her family out of the Santa Barbara area and closer to us. They are now renting a house for less than what they had been paying previously for a studio apartment. They're both working and they can afford to live again (instead of merely surviving).\n\nAs for the crime, that's mostly in those same oversized cities, too. That's right. People are actually overpaying for the luxury of being mugged and shot at more frequently. The rest of us don't have to deal with such things. We let the city dwellers keep their disgusting criminals to themselves. I read the same news stories as you do and my every day life is affected just as little by them as yours. \n\nYou go ahead and keep feeling bad for those of us in the US.

As i was growing up, we regularly heard reports on the news about mass shooting and other serious crimes in the US. I regularly heard my parents and grand parents say how awful it must be to live there. And even recently, we still hear reports of mass shootings. There are more murders in Washington DC in one month than there are in the UK for a whole year! As a country, it's true that the US is very wealthy. But I repeat.....as a country! The disparity between the wealthy and poor in the US is wider than any other country. The wealthy truly are wealthy, but there are far far more people living in absolute poverty! I regularly send money to friends of mine in NY state, as they struggle to survive. \nOur health service in the Uk does have problems, it's true, but it is still one of the best in the world. If I am ill, I don't have to worry about receiving hospital care. The same cannot be said about the US. Going into the hospital has resulted in many Americans going bankrupt. \nNo wonder you all carry guns.....crime is so high there. What an awful country to live in!",
