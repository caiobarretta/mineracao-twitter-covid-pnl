        "textDisplay": "It's my recollection that the Media did an ABSOLUTELY horrible job in explaining the importance of the TPP around the 2016 time-frame when Donald railed against it (Bernie wanted to strengthen the US position with a renegotiated deal, but Donald just trashed it without ANY substitute).  Sorry, I blame the media for it's softball, pseudo-economic coverage.  Go back and look at my comments from 2016 - I predicted that our pull-out without a substitute was a missed opportunity of immense significance, basically handing China a golden platter to control the region.  The covid supply distuptions offer us an opportunity to reset a little.  Don't make the same mistake again, Media, of poo-poo'ing global economic pacts negotiated in our favor.  But what about jobs?  Ok, solar, wind, \"green\" initiatives.",
