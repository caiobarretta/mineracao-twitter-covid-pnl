        "textDisplay": "Hong Kong's health system has its up and down. \nDue to other factors, not everyone can afford the cheaper medical care compared to the US. High rent and low wages often prevent people to visit doctors. There are public non-hospital clinics, but do have long lines. Unless you're stay at home parent (which is rare) or an elderly, you usually don't have time to visit these clinics since you'll be working.\nBut many basic services and medication are cheap and no insurance required. \nIf I have a cold in Hong Kong, I'll go see a doctor for a low price and they will give me some light medication, especially symptom reducing anti-histamines. If I have a cold in the US, I'll avoid the doctor because usually, they'll just say get some rest and have chicken noodle soup. \nDoctors in Hong Kong are more willing to give medication than US doctors, but more reluctant to prescribe long term medication. Ironically, the ease of giving out medication hasn't lead to abuse or dependency like the US, probably because most of the medication are weaker than the US. \nCost are also kept down thanks to the avoidance of unnecessary medical procedures. An annual physical is considered unnecessary for people under 60s... I was laughed at when I requested a physical at age of 24. They still let me have a physical and it costed less than a Red Lobster dinner for two in the US. \nBecause of the cheap basic doctor's visit, people are not as reluctant to go for a visit. If you happened to have a serious health issue, it'll probably get caught. \nER in Hong Kong can get overwhelming if you're not dying, especially during flu season. Ambulance is free and if you're actually dying, they are pretty fast at fixing you up. \nDental is also cheap. I can get a cleaning without insurance cheaper than a single Red Lobster dinner in the US.",
