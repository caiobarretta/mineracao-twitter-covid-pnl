There are so many things I can't possibly know yet about it that I can only ballpark it with existing services that do some key aspects of it.\n\nAnd on top of that I'm outright assuming they can make a sewage plumbing insert device that safely allows injection of chemicals into a testing chamber. I know the cartridge deployment mechanism would work, but a chemical or biological test that can be conducted on a small sample of the liquid component of raw sewage and read with some kind of sensor that can be protected from the sewage...that's another matter. I know certain things CAN be tested that way and others can't, and it could well be that anything a politician would want to test is in the \"can't\" pile.\n\nAs a side note, though, this wouldn't need PPE with how I'm envisioning it for the cartridge system. The cartridge would be a bit like an inkjet cartridge with a nozzle interface to the device and a liquid inside. The device would have a mechanism for pumping a controlled amount out of the cartridge also like with an inkjet, and this would go into a waiting chamber. The waiting chamber would be entrance-sealed, flushed into a mixing chamber, then exit-sealed.

        "textOriginal": "@cgi2002 Yeah, that's why I kept emphasizing that they were lowball, very rough numbers. There are so many things I can't possibly know yet about it that I can only ballpark it with existing services that do some key aspects of it.\n\nAnd on top of that I'm outright assuming they can make a sewage plumbing insert device that safely allows injection of chemicals into a testing chamber. I know the cartridge deployment mechanism would work, but a chemical or biological test that can be conducted on a small sample of the liquid component of raw sewage and read with some kind of sensor that can be protected from the sewage...that's another matter. I know certain things CAN be tested that way and others can't, and it could well be that anything a politician would want to test is in the \"can't\" pile.\n\nAs a side note, though, this wouldn't need PPE with how I'm envisioning it for the cartridge system. The cartridge would be a bit like an inkjet cartridge with a nozzle interface to the device and a liquid inside.

Alot of homes use sewage lines that tend to run along a main that may be in the back of a garden or underneath a basement. So to access them your looking at much closer to several minutes per household. Don't know if you worked this into your math, but that said garbage trucks also tend to have 3-5 staff so it may average out if the swaps are on average about 2mins.\n\nAlso I skipped a cost, maintenance. Units will from time to time need fully replacing (hopefully that can be done via the access thats been built for the refills), and occasionally there will be collapsed access pipes, or if the access pipe is on public land, overgrowth. \n\nThen you also need to plan for PPE costs, garbage men tend not to be sticking their hands in the garbage. Also the PPE would need to be replaced/cleaned between properties to avoid cross contamination on the refills and thus invalidating any results of value. Could also argue under this that these would be sewer workers and not refuse, I doubt they'll work for the same wages as refuse workers. \n\nWhen you really start to dig into this, it becomes a much more complex project than at first glance. Installing it in an existing location would be exceptionally expensive, however doing it during the construction of a neighbourhood were you can set up central sewage hubs it would be far cheaper (been able to open 1 manhole and change 10-20 at a time).",
