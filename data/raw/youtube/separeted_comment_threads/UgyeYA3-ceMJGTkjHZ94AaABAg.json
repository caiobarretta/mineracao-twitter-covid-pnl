        "textDisplay": "\u200b@choopa The problem with comparing vaccine immunity to natural immunity is that natural immunity is unpredictable. Some people (who get really sick usually) have a tonker of a response that will last the rest of their lives. Others (who get mild disease, we're not sure exactly why this is, perhaps they were exposed to a low dose etc) don't build much of a measurable (in terms of IGG antibodies) immune response at all. So there is a big difference, the immunity status of the vaccinated in so far as it can be measured (IGG antibodies) is predictable, and the immunity status of the unvaccinated is completely unpredictable. It is very difficult to measure mucosal IGA antibodies so we don't bother yet they might play a big role. I hope that helps to answer your first question. \n\nYour second question about whether this strain of the virus is deadly to the fit and healthy, personally I think it is. I base this on two papers (Chertow et al, December 2021, and Al-Aly et al, October 2021). Even those who have mild/asymptomatic disease appear to have live virus replicating in their brains at a minimum of 230 days later and everyone who is not hospitalized gets a 200% or so increase to the leading causes of death (stroke/heart failure etc) for 12 months after recovering from an infection. It's not clear if these elevated risks continue for 24 months or heaven forbid 50 years and what that means for life-expectancy. \n\nYour last question, about the number of people who have had issues with vaccines.. Check the various reporting systems internationally. The amercian one, israelies, UK etc try to find a middle-ground. Just remember you can reduce the effects by making sure you don't get jabbed while your antibody levels are high. They could be high because of a natural infection, or even because you had the first dose too recently.. You can reduce the side-effects of the second dose by delaying it for a few more weeks. So long as you're within 16 weeks from first to second dose your immune quality will just improve the longer you leave it (according to a study by pfizer). Just don't catch COVID in the meantime else you might have a stroke 5 years later and regret it for the rest of your life.",
