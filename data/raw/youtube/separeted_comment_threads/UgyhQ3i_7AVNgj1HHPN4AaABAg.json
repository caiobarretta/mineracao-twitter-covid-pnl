It is a significant hassle even to get tested once, even in the nicer suburbs of Los Angeles.    The health system is clearly broken.    Had your second test also been positive, then what is the optimal course of action?    This information would be of great benefit to your viewers.",

        "textDisplay": "As an addendum to my previous comment,  the testing labs for COVID-19 here in Southern California have a reputation both anecdotally and online in consumer ratings, for overbilling, double billing, not providing results, long delays in providing results, having not phone number for billing or other inquiries, employing \"clowns in white lab coats\" ( as one educated person reported), etc., etc.    This is a big problem that needs prompt fixing, especially with COVID-19 numbers increasing.     The test costs often are $500 or more per test, and this is often after insurance pays for a portion of the testing.     It almost seems both a scam and a means to diminish testing to reduce the numbers for political reasons.    Thankfully, Trump will soon be gone, but in the intervening months, his incompetence can cause considerable death and destruction.",
