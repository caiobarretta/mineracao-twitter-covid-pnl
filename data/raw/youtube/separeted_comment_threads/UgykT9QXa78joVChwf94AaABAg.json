The Virus-Backbone (the \"ball\" in case of a Coronavirus) is from a Bat-Coronavirus (BatCoV) and the Spike-protein (the spike around the \"ball\") is from a Pangolin- or Civet or etc. -Coronavirus (or very closely related).\n\nHow did that came to be in the first place?\nYou normally see point-mutations in the spike-protein, when it is a zoonosis/\"zoonotic spillover\".\nIf you look at the sequence compared to other similar Coronaviruses, you can see a \"kink\" in the graph (the graph represents genetic similarity across the genome [x] in percent [y]). That's exactly where the RNA which forms the Backbone begins/ends and the Spike-sequence begins/ends.\n\n\n2. The Receptor-Binding-Domain (RBD = the thing on top of the spike, which attaches to the cell) has a Poly-basic Furin-Cleavage-Site (FCS). Don't get afraid of the word. I'll try to explain it.\n\nThe FCS causes higher binding-affinity to a cell than the virus would have without it, hence it is more infectious and can theoretically easier and faster attach to a cell and hence (possibly) spread faster in a body as well.\n\n\na. SARS-CoV-2 \"acquired\" this FCS via 4 rare Insert-mutations. That basically means, the RNA got 4 bases longer there.\n\nGuess what RNA-Viruses are prone to... Point-mutations (one base changes, length remains the same), which is why we have 20000 (or so) identified/sequenced variations of SARS-CoV-2 already out there.\n\nGuess what appears in an RNA-sequence, when an insert-mutation occurs naturally. Point-mutations at the \"joining points\", which is the exact reason why they (media) are telling us the lie \"you would see lab-manipulation\", while in fact (or at least AFAIK) ONLY lab-derived insert-mutations can occur without point-mutations at the joints.\n\nImagine a white thread. Cut it and use a red thread to bind both pieces together with knots... The red thread is the insert-mutation, the knots the joints.\nHow do you get a white-red-white thread without knots? You use a red pen and paint it red!\n(The \"white thread\" is actually 4 colors, but we don't have to make the example unnecessarily complex.)\n\nThese techniques to insert genes without identifiable markers, exists since 1992. The first of these so-called \"no see um\"-techniques was invented at Johnson and Johnson.\n\nSo... 4(!) insert-mutations NEXT TO EACH OTHER, in that specific spot and no point mutations right next to it.\n\n\nb. The FCS has a double-Arginin next to each other. CGG-CGG codons are used in labs and I don't know if this codon-sequence ever was observed in nature before or even via serial passaging.\nIt was used in at least 11 lab-experiments regarding splicing an FCS into an RBD. At least one of those experiments was being conducted in Wuhan btw., which is open scientific information that the WIV published themselves.\n\n\n3. Some might argue, that a virus could acquire a FCS naturally, but\na. this has never been observed in a Coronavirus and there is no known sequence of even ONE Coronavirus, which has one. Oh... I forgot... There \"is\" ONE! RaTG13, which the WIV miraculously found in their (btw. offline-taken) Database after quite a while, after the sequence was published!\n\nb. Also... FCS in (other) viruses are acquired via point-mutations, not insert-mutations.\n\nc. Recombination is no alternative either, because it must have gotten the sequence from another Coronavirus which incidentially infected the same cell. If that would have been the case, the Virus must have gotten an already existing sequence from either Coronavirus which infected the cell, which brings us back to \"a\". There are none, which exhibit this feature/sequence, hence it can not have acquired it via recombination either.\n\n\n4. The \"nsp7-protein\" is 100% genetically IDENTICAL to another BatCoV (either BatCoV ZXC21 or ZC45... I have to look at it again.)!\n\n5. Neurotoxic epitopes on the spike-protein.\n\n6.
