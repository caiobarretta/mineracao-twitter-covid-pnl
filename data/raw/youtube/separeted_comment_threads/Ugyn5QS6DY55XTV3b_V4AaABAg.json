        "textDisplay": "Dear Biolution, I congratulate you for the impressive animation. I would like you to suggest to prepare a new animation. Because there is a great need for this. As you might know, SARS-CoV-2 needs two protein from host cell: ACE2 and TMSSR2. ACE2 is angiotensin converting enzyme 2 and TMPRSS2 is transmembrane serine protease. It would be very nice if you can prepare an animation related to binding of spike protein of SARS-CoV-2 to ACE2. As you also might know that this is not enough for virus to show its effect on host. Other protein, TMPRSS2 is also needed for priming the spike protein of SARS-CoV-2. I think this could be animated and it is needed. Thanks in advance, Levent Cavas, Dokuz Eylul University, Department of Biotechnology, \u0130zmir-Turkey",
