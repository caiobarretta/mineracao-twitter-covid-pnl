        "textDisplay": "I had used your rapid antigen tests in the past and honesty they were the best, albeit very expensive.\nHowever, in the past few months the quality has fallen dramatically: lower quality cassettes, courser and thicker wands, uneven pigment development and generally a low quality feel. I've tried many boxes, not just one. The price, despite the lower quality, wasn't reduced however, so that means higher margins.\nI am extremely disappointed and do not recommend your tests over other brands, unless you return to the original quality.",
