The abovr comment brought me back to our conversation. \nI agree with you completely, and you're right that I shouldn't be so elitist in demanding such \"electronic completion.\" I remember seeing an amazing paper that had evolved the function of a polymerase to take a modified substrate. But they couldn't \"prove\" the mechanism, so they did a series of multiple experiments where the took the polymerase and purposely gave it the substrate but lacking a Mg/Mn+2 cofactor. This caused the rxn to stay but they could then get an NMR measurement. Next they allowed the rxn to proced but not complete, they somehow clogged the exit position somehow (can't remember), but made another measurement. Lastly, they stalled the enzyme by giving it an inhibitor so the rxn cannot proceed, measure. Using these 3-6 measurements, they duct-taped together the approximate NMR structures and generated an animation that showed the enzyme function. Absolutely mind-boggling, since it would work by twisting the substrate around in order to let it orient in the new strand position. So, yes low rez animation can make an amazing proof.\n\nBut, can't we always strive for computation completeness?",

Proteins need to be modelled on different timescales. Ligands bind and react on picosecond timescales, proteins fold on microsecond timescales. Which is one reason why CPMD, Car-Parinello QM/MM exists at all, where the QM part uses DFT. Still research in directed evolution of proteins seems more sensible. QM/MM is more usefull for predicting properties of perovskites for solar panels. Electron-electron, multi-body interactions are a pain in the but..
