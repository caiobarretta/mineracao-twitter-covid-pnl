I have been struggling financially and mentally because I lost my job as a social worker because I declined the vaccine. I declined due to my  pre existing health conditions heart disease and lupus. I\u2019m on a ton of medications already warfarin and  blood thinners. Living with lupus is challenging I\u2019m in constant pain. I was denied my medical/religious exemption from Forsyth hospital. Since losing my job I\u2019ve been struggling to provide for my two children. I\u2019m so overwhelmed because both of my boys are autistic. So they require a lot out of me. My husband passed away three years ago so I\u2019m all alone. I\u2019m so down and depressed over my circumstances. I have been called horrible names and mocked because of my situation. I was even accused of lying by christians which really hurt my heart. Every month is a struggle and I\u2019m in fear of being homeless. But I have so much faith that God will provide for me and my children.",
