Look how small korea is; its from generations of fighting amongst our own blood. believe it or not, during the peak of its reign, Goguryeo, controlled most of the korean peninsula and nearly half of china. its fall was contributed to family feud and the invasion of shinla, another korean kingdom, which later day, became the unified territory of goryeo, then joseon, which also later split due to soviet/communistic influence. Now, we have two korean countries, speaking the same language with similar appearances, but the two countries can't be more different.",
