        "textDisplay": "I live in Northern Virginia 25min from Washington D.C My whole family got infected and it was due to doctor telling my brother to stay home. With no test he was super sick ! With a fever and because they told him not to get tested he spread it to our whole family and myself. When I got it I went to my primary care as directed to us from the health department I had to argue with the doctor to get tested! And we waited a whole week to get the results. The clinic was horrible to us. Only cared about getting paid. When I said my brother is terribly sick they only asked for his insurance and when I told them he was uninsured they just quoted how much everything would cost. Over 150 just to be seen and for a flu test first. He couldn\u2019t afford it. We are now being monitored by phone calls from the health Department and dont get the luxury to test the rest of the family, stay in a hospital or get retested to help us know. We are being told if something gets worse call the on call nurse or call 911. They are going to tell us if we don\u2019t have anymore symptoms to wait 3 days after that before we can leave the house for groceries. We get 3 phone calls.Me and my two brothers have survived the virus with a few symptoms no fever anymore but my parents have been sick for over a week and the cough and fever just won\u2019t go away...",
