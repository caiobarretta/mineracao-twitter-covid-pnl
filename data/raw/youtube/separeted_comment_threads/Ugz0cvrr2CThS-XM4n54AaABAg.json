California has but highest case rate but they also have 38 million people\n\nBased on prior trends, we could see as high as six hundred deaths per day in 2 weeks.\n\nAlmost all the deaths are among people with no vaccinations at all in the hospitalization by vaccination status databases that I looked at.
