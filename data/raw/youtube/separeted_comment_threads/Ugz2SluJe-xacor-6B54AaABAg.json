        "textDisplay": "Covid - 19 may or may not be real, but the health system in India is so obsessed with it now that people coming into hospitals with emergencies due to far more fatal diseases are not treated as emergencies. That should change and there must be a solution to that!! I myself went through a grim situation with profuse bleeding and was detected with stage 3 cancer during lockdown last year. The difficulties I faced with while getting treated at a government facility for a non covid life threatening disease somehow still makes me doubt the genuineness of this disease and its handling in India. During the treatment period, I was tested thrice for covid, once during the time our ward was declared as a containment zone, and every time, I was negative. So, my humble request to Indian government is to kindly put into place a system where  non covid emergencies are given attention and treated seriously.",
