However, that is not the only way to cause such an event in a lab, intentionally or otherwise. For one thing, your proposed theory of a recombination event in a host with multiple infections could have happened in a lab that is a literal repository of bat coronaviruses. That host could have even been a researcher. It would not be the first time a researcher accidentally infected themselves.\n\nOf course, we aren\u2019t allowed to talk about that on youtube and even this comment is enough to get me banned.",
