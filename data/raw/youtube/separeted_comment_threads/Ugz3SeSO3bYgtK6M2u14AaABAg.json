        "textDisplay": "Thank you for a wonderful lecture. Would you also, please, do a lecture comparing the Pfizer, Moderna, and J&J vaccines? I am under the impression that the J&J (which I got) was tested in places where Covid variants were more prevalent, and that affected the results. I was assured that it was an excellent vaccine, but can't help wondering if it is not as good as Pfizer or Moderna. Thanks again for your great lectures.\nUpdate: I watched your explanation of the Pfizer, Moderna, ans Astra Zeneca vaccines. Applied the AZ function to J & J. Makes sense, sounds like a good vaccine, so I don\u2019t understand why so many MDs on YouTube are implying J & J is a second choice. The message is, just take whatever you can get, but the Pfizer and Moderna are the gold standard. Please explain.",
