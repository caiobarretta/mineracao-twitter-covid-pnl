If you're confused about where the \"Corona\" menu is, it's in the same menu line as is \"File\" or \"Edit\" :)\n\nIf you are a 3ds Max user then you can access the library by bringing up the \"Render Setup\" window go under the \"Scene\" compartment and in there you'll see a button to open up the Material Library.\n\nIn both DCCs once you have the Material Library open you just click and drag those materials onto your objects / your material editors.\n\nHope that helps!\nNejc",
