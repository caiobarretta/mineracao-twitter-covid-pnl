New temporary field hospitals are built to treat the overflow covid patients. Recovered Omicron patients can be reinfected with the new subvariants as the B.2 S-proteins are so tricky for medicines. Currently, no medicine is effective to prevent the B.2 subvariants infection. Mask wearing is the only solution for now to prevent the subvariant attacks. Reactions of covid medicines with aging, pre-existing mefical conditions, and covid infection are the main cause of new covid deaths,  or further covid body damages.",
