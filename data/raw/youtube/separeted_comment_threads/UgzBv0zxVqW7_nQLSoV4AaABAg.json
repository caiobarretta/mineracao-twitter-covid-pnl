If people really understood how complicated of a system that virus\u2019s are, maybe they would have all  thought before they wanted to go about their days like there was not a global pandemic on earth.  The more the virus spreads, the more likely it is that it will mutate and be harder to manage.  Well, at least the more it will spread.  Anyways.  I wish I wish I wish.:. Unfortunately it seems the virus is going to go through the entire human  population on earth as well as other animals.  I saw an article saying someone\u2019s dog was positive? Is that true? Anyways- good luck to the world",
