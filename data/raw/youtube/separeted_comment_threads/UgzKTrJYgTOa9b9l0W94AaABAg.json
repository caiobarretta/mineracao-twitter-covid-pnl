        "textDisplay": "I came up with a short film based on the bad events currently happening. I call it, \"The Cursed Year\". This features a parody of the coronavirus. In the short, the main villain represents the coronavirus and is a bat (in reference to the rumors of the bat soup starting the coronavirus). He causes the year to go wrong to try and destroy the world. But that is just one of the main problems of the short (And it is the most prominent one too).",
