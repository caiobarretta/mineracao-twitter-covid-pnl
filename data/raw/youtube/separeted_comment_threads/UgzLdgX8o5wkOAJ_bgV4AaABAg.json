Dazak also has deep professional and financial relationship with the WIV and CCP. It's like asking members of the oil lobby to investigate climate change.\n\nAlso, not only were the bats and pangolins being blamed for animal transfer not being sold at the wet market as claimed, their natural habitat is in a completely different region. If it were passed form an animal, the likelihood is that the origin would be in South China like with SARs, not in a central region they aren't even natural too.",
