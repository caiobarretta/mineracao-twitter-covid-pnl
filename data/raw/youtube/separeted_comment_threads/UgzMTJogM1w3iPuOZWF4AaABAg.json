        "textDisplay": "Hi Erik. I'm a person with Asperger's Syndrome who was so inspired by  your song and the video. Thank you for the gift of your song and the inspiration it brought. I love it so much that I used it for my PE3 Exam to showcase even just a few of my dance moves. I'm not really an awesome dancer because I am differently wired  but I know what I did in the video would cause people out there who may dance silly to fight against Covid 19 like I did in my project using your cool song. More success to you.",
