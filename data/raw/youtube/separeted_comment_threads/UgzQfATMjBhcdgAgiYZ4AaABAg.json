There, it uses the host cell's RNA to replicate the entered virus into copies of new viruses.\n3. The new viruses then release its own exotoxins that infect the host cell and the host cell apoptosizes (dies off), and the new viruses are released to attack new host cells, and then replicate once more, and then kills off more good host cells, and then the replication and more host cell apoptoses happen again - a vicious cycle.\n4. ARDS - This is when a severe localized pulmonary cytokine storm caused by overinflammation of the immune system affects the lobes, bronchial tubes, and more often, the air sacs of the lungs, by pulmonary-infiltrate-filled fluid. This blocks severely the exchange of oxygen and carbon dioxide in the respiratory system It can worsen with time to respiratory failure, and then sepsis and then septic shock where blood pressure goes dangerously down to severe hypotension, and can lead to TSS (multi-organ failure, including heart failure), which can cause the person to die.",
