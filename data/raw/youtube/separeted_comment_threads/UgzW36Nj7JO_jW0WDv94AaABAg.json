SARS (a type of coronavirus) used a lytic cycle, as it ends in the destruction of the host cell, and we see that in how rapid the onset of symptoms are. Whereas covid-19 doesn\u2019t seem to be showing the same quick onset, so it may be using a lysogenic cycle. If someone could answer w an explanation, thanks!! I need it for a project haha",
