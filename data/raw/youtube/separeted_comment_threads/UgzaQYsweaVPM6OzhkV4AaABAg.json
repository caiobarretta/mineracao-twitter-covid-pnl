Monarchy is a structure of government whereas communism is an economic methodology.  Bottom line, NK is screwed up because of communism, not because of monarchy.  Even if you eliminated the monarch, NK would likely not change.  Instead, the communist torch would be picked up by another. So I guess, I'm saying that you are misdiagnosing the problem. The underlying Marx idea is collective ownership.  Many interpret this idea as a \"paradise of equality\" as you put it.  However, even in a perfect world, it would not produce a paradise because it eliminates the individual upon which the collective depends. Communism is a paradox and contradicts itself. Equality is only theoretically possible because communism strips individuals of personal agency making them all slaves to the collective. Earthy implementations consolidate power to a central state government resulting in authoritarian dictatorships which have universally failed to create equality by the very nature of a powerful state controlling the individual (inherently created two classes).  Again, a paradox.  Who is in power is irrelevant. The communist ideal is flawed at it's very core.  I recommend  reading \"The Gulag Archipelago\" to better understand communism.  NK is typically classified as one party socialist republic (which describes its economic method) totalitarian hereditary dictatorship (which describes who implements that economic method).  Again, as you said, hereditary dictatorship can be compared to a monarchy.",
