My arm was broken, my cheek was cut, I had a lot of stitches, I had a convulsion, I was hospitalized for 15 days and even I was given food 3 times a day. I didn't pay any of them. I heard that calling an ambulance is paid in other countries, but it is free in Turkey. In my opinion, Turkey is among the best in the healthcare system.",
