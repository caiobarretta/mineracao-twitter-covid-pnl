I was \u201csick\u201d two or three times over the past year, nothing lasted more than 3 days and it was nothing more than a slight cough, runny nose, and general cold symptoms. We were around people with COVID and never got sick directly after. Tried to get tested but the clinics weren\u2019t open 24 hours and my employer wouldn\u2019t let us call off to get tested. So we couldn\u2019t go. Many people got told they \u201cprobably\u201d had it. Not tested. Many people I know who had it said it was nothing more than a cold for a couple days. All the way from toddlers to grown adults. I have one family member who is in icu with COVID now. Failing kidneys and medically induced coma. I really don\u2019t understand the science behind how they classify symptoms when there\u2019s such a huge disparity. I think there\u2019s a lot of confusion with someone in dire straits having COVID and COVID causing there situations. Which is probably not usually the case. Idk, there\u2019s a lot of questions I still have about the whole thing.",
