There are some positive results, which may be beginning to bring the hospital death toll down, but there is still a long way to go towards something a cure all. In our video we mention Remdesivir and convalescent plasma, and research has shown they are working, but here are 4 others, which have received some attention recently, we did not kow about when our  video on potential COVID-19 treatments was made. Not so surpringly chloroquine is not the game changer: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jw2OvPnx_lQ \n\r\n1. Dexamethasone\r\nThis is the success story \u2013 a very cheap drug, in plentiful supply around the world \u2013 that has been shown to save lives. The low-dose steroid was responsible for the survival of one in eight patients on ventilators during the Oxford University-based Recovery trial. The results were announced in mid-June and the steroid is now standard treatment for the sickest patients. The data is reliable because it comes from the biggest randomised trial of Covid-19 treatments in the world, involving almost all hospitals in the UK. Dexamethasone has been around for 60 years, so is out of patent and cheap.\r\n\n2. Tocilizumab\r\nA number of anti-inflammatory treatments are being tested to see if they can help. When the immune system responds to the coronavirus, it can cause inflammation. Tocilizumab, an antibody normally used to treat rheumatoid arthritis, is given by injection to block the inflammatory protein IL-6. Patients given the drug during the serious Covid-19 outbreak in Italy in March appeared to benefit and were less likely to end up on a ventilator or die. But the numbers were relatively small and this was an observational study, not a randomised trial set up to judge the outcomes of people with and without the drug. The Recovery trial is also investigating Tocilizumab. Roche has said that recent trials have been disappointing, but the company wants to explore other ways of using the drug.\r\n\r\n3. Blood pressure pills\r\n\rScientists think people on medication because of their blood pressure would be well advised to stay on it. A paper from the University of East Anglia found that the risk of critical illness or death from Covid for people with high blood pressure was found to be significantly lower if they were taking angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEi) or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARB). That does not mean those drugs would be helpful to anyone with coronavirus infection who does not suffer from high blood pressure.\r\n\r\n4. Inhaled interferon beta\r\nA small study from scientists at Southampton University suggests that an inhaler containing the drug interferon beta, used to treat multiple sclerosis, could be effective. The three academics behind it, who formed a spin-off company for their product in 2004, became paper millionaires when they announced the results of their trial on Covid-19 patients in July. The trial involved just 101 patients at 9 hospitals. Those inhaling the drug left hospital sooner and were more likely to recover, but the data was not published in full. Larger trials are needed.\r\n(taken from an article published on August 24 in The Guardian: https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/aug/24/six-of-the-most-promising-treatments-for-covid-19-so-far?)",
