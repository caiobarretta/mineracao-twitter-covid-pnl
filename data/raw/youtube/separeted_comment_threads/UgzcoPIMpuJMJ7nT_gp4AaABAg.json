We have bred dogs over many thousands of years to not just live around us but to see us as family. Dogs generally see humans as kin. They do not respond to being \"farmed\" for meat in the way bovines do. Go google slaughterhouse survivors or any of a number of rescues for meat trade dogs. If that doesn't bother you, you should also look at how these animals are treated before and during slaughter. What happens to meat dogs in china shouldn't happen to any animal and isn't legal to do to cows here either. We do not beat, burn, boil or otherwise torture the live animals before slaughter in some asshat idea that it makes the meat better. Granted, the methods of animal handling in the US have become shocking but china takes the cake. I don't especially care who eats meat... but be aware of what is going on and for fuck sake.... dogs are not livestock.",
