This & your first video are crazy informative and your sense of humor totally on point.  \nHelped to crack a smile in relation to the epidemic despite my proximity to patient zero in NYC, my father\u2019s decision to return to practice in the trauma bay and ICU after yrs of retirement... and his immediate family living in the south of Italy.  \nIt helps to laugh, even if when it feels like the end of days.   Namaste.",
