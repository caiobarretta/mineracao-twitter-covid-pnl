I\u2018m a business owner myself and from what i can tell, 40-60% of small businesses will perish if the quarantine last longer than a month from now. We have to continue paying our rent, and salaries/social securities to our employees. 1) Government mandates firms like us to pay at least minimal salaries to our staffs(\u00a52590+ss\u00a51628). Laying off staffs is the last option if the company quenches its cashflow. 2) Government indeed gives order to SOC to exempt firms rent for 6 months but in reality, SOCs are using private companies to sign contracts with us tenants.",
