I hope China gets through this horrible time",

There are many gods in China, most of them are changed from people, they become gods because they do a lot of good things for people.   Therefore, Chinese gods serve the people.   If they are not good to the people, they will be brought down.   The first missionaries to China were shocked when they saw this.So if you tell the Chinese that power is given by God, the Chinese will just say, \"It's up to me, not god.\" It may be hard for people who don't know other cultures to understand, but the world is so diverse",
