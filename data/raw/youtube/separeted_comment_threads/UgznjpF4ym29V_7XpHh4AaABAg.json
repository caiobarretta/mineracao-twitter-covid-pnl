        "textDisplay": "Compared with the covid peak in Hong Kong, the messy arrangement about transferring people to quarantine facilities was similar. Shanghai even arrange disinfection, go to your home to do the test. At that time, HK ppl only can stay at home, do RAT test or line-up in the testing center for few hours waiting 2 days to get the result, did the disinfection by ourself. However, for cases that the whole family got covid, HK allows them to stay at home.  I got covid at the peak time, i was thankful that i was transferred to the quarantine facilities so that my older family member didnt got covid, still stay healthy now.",
