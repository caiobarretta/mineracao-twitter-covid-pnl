I know he's only going by what was said in the media by Oxford, but when it comes to DNA, I can't help but think of the CCR5 cell. I know that they reported that it doesn't effect our genetics, but it's way too soon to know that! When you think about HIV and the 2 receptors that it needs to have a binding affect, it's from CD4 and CCR5, but in people where the CCR5 was defective, you won't catch the virus. It wasn't until a few years ago that we learned how when you change your own CCR5 or completely get rid of it, that you lose an average of a third of your lifespan. So I am a skeptic, but if there was more transparency, I would be able to research it on my own, and not make a rash decision.",
