Most notably the westernized countries had diets consisting of largely processed food and small amounts of produce. All other countries generally had a diet of primarily fresh foods. Obviously with globalization and refrigeration, canned goods, frozen foods, and the like have made their way into the diets of these countries too. But, for the most part, still not a huge part of their diet.",
