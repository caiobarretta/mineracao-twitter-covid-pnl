For 3 days only, he was prescribed 100,000 vitamin A each day, for 3 days only.  Vitamin D 50,000 each day for 3 days only.  Vitamin C 1000mg 3x a day for 3 days only.  Dr. also prescribed some  Budesonide/nebulizer treatments and the FLCCC protocol for covid.  My father was able to avoid a hospital visit because I was familiar with this protocol and we started it as soon as we found out.  My father was healed in less than a week and a half.",
